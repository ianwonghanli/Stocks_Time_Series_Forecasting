Unlike last May, there’s arguably lots to look forward to as vaccinations gain steam. People are back at baseball stadiums, and the Kentucky Derby and Memorial Day picnics loom. Oh yeah, we’ve also got the April jobs report straight ahead.
OK, so maybe jobs data aren’t as exciting as a famous race or a full picnic basket after a year without many fun events. Having said that, the April non-farm payrolls data scheduled for Friday, May 7, could help set the tone in a big way for stocks and bonds this coming month, which makes it more than just another hum-drum economic report.
Payrolls, along with the aftermath of April’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, could affect trading in the days and weeks ahead, giving a sense of whether jobs strength continued from March and if it’s strong enough to get investors worrying more about potential economic overheating.
There’s a lot to May beyond the jobs report and anything Fed governors may say in their upcoming presentations, but it’s hard to argue those aren’t two key factors. Other things to watch include continued Q1 earnings, progress fighting the pandemic both in the U.S. and overseas, any developments with the Biden infrastructure plan, and any news in what’s been an active M&A scene.

FIGURE 1: TECH OUTPACED. This year-to-date chart of the S&P 500 Index (SPX—  candlestick) vs. the Nasdaq-100 (NDX—purple line) shows the broader market generally out-pacing the Tech-heavy NDX so far in 2021. Does this pattern continue in May, or can Tech find new traction? Data Sources: Nasdaq, S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform. For illustrative purposes only.

From Famine To Feast With Employment Data
Last May started off with whatever the opposite of a “bang” might be. The April payrolls report released then showed more than 20 million Americans losing their jobs and the unemployment rate skyrocketing to 14.7%. We were all basically at the mercy of an unseen enemy.
Fast-forward to this March. Job growth hit 916,000 and the unemployment rate fell to 6%. That rate is still way above pre-pandemic unemployment, and you can’t forget that millions remain jobless. Even considering all that, it was a really good sign of improvement that could set the stage to see if positive growth continued into April.
Early signals look solid. We’ve just seen two of the lowest initial weekly jobless claims data since before Covid, at under 600,000. That’s still a lot, but remember it was over a million for a while last year. It’s early to make predictions on April payrolls, but these newer numbers continue to see the trend move in the right direction and that’s what you want.
The question is whether another huge payrolls number—which isn’t assured, in part because some March gains might have reflected hiring delays from weather-related ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['News', 'M&A', 'Earnings', 'Commodities', 'Treasuries', 'Federal Reserve', 'Pre-Market Outlook', 'Markets', 'General']",0.86662,Neutral,https://amp.benzinga.com/amp/content/20838606

Since early March, these recovery stocks have petered out, replaced by a sort of musical chairs of equity front-runners, from classic big tech companies to utilities and staples stocks. The power of the core cyclical trade fizzled in tandem with the climb in Treasury bond yields, which have been under pressure since the month began. But now, they’re waking up again.

What Happened: Mark Cuban is placing a wager against Peter Mallouk, the President and CEO of Creative Planning, a wealth management company.
Cuban will bet $1 million on a 50/50 split of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) stock versus Mallouk’s pick of the S&P 500 (ARCA: SPY) over the next ten years. The winner will see their favorite charity receive the proceeds of the bet.

We’re having an initial reaction now where everything sells off and rates are pushing higher, but we’ve already seen hints of this coming from earnings. Based on what executives said, it would be hard to believe if there wasn’t some inflation pressure developing and showing up in today’s number.
This is one report, so it’s nothing to lose our minds over, but it backs up what we’ve been hearing. To recap, the consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.8% last month, compared with Wall Street’s consensus for 0.2%. The CPI is up 4.2% year-over-year. These are big numbers, but remember that last year set a low bar considering the struggles with Covid at the time. 
The S&P 500 Index (SPX) was already lower in pre-market trading before the data hit, and immediately dived when CPI came out. The 10-year Treasury yield also ticked up a couple basis points to just under 1.65%. It was below 1.5% at one point last week, so this is a pretty big move. Volatility also edged up after the news. Higher rates might have a chance of helping the Financial sector today if they can hold the line against what looks like a lot of pressure coming from the rest of the market. 
Rising inflation numbers over time might get the Fed worried, but Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has made it clear over and over that we should expect inflation and that it will be temporary. With the easy comparisons to a year ago continuing over the next few months, it might not be until Q4 when we get a true picture of the price situation. 
CME Fed funds futures now show a 9% chance of a rate hike by the end of the year, up from 7% earlier this week. Historically, readings like those don’t show much worry about increasing rates. However, if inflation continues to ramp up, it might put more focus on when the Fed might start “tapering” some of its bond-buying.
The intense inflation focus heads into day two tomorrow when the government releases the April producer price index (PPI). Circling back, the March report might have given many investors an unpleasant shock, rising a full 1% month over month. Analysts had expected decent gains, but not that dramatic.
For tomorrow’s April PPI, the Wall Street consensus, according to Briefing.com, is 0.3% for the headline PPI and 0.4% for core, which excludes food and energy. Those aren’t low numbers, but remember the comparison is against the big gain in March. For more on what to watch beyond the headlines in PPI, see below. 
Stepping away from prices, the Tech slide that briefly halted late yesterday appears ready to resume this morning following weakness overnight in the FAANG stocks. Semiconductor shares also came under pressure in overnight trading. On the charts, Tech is beginning to show some technical weakness, which may weigh on these stocks as the day continues. 
Having said that, yesterday’s rally in the Nasdaq (COMP) was nothing short of incredible. Some of the recovery may have reflected “buy the dip” mentality (see more below). It’s going to be worth checking to see if that happens again on today’s early weakness.
Asian and European markets were mixed overnight, while crude resumed its climb and is now above $66 a barrel. 
Inflation? Taxes? A Combination? Struggles Continue
If it seems like the market just can’t get going lately, that’s because it can’t. In general, there’s this thought that inflation may rear its ugly head. We see a little bit higher rates, not significantly, but a bit. And this struggle between value and growth continues at the same time.

But it also seems that investors may be coming to grips with the prospect of higher prices, especially those that buy into the Fed’s view of “transitory” inflation.
The government’s April producer price index registered a 0.6% increase, ahead of a Briefing.com consensus forecast of a 0.3% gain. The PPI news comes one day after the government’s April consumer price index rose far more than expected, with the core CPI gaining 0.9% when a Briefing.com consensus had expected that inflation metric to rise just 0.3%.
The market, as gauged by equity index futures this morning, didn’t seem to react too much initially to the producer inflation data. Despite concerns about inflation, it appears that yesterday’s bad news on the inflationary front cushioned the blow of the PPI data somewhat. It may also be that the PPI news is somewhat offset by a better-than-expected reading on initial jobless claims, which came in at 473,000 when 510,000 had been expected in a Briefing.com consensus.
Rising inflation has been worrying Wall Street as investors fear the Fed may have to respond by tapering its asset purchases or raising its key interest rate sooner than expected. Inflation expectations have also been hurting growth stocks, including big tech-related names, because expectations of rising costs can dent the outlook for profitability for these companies.
The Gas Pipeline Metaphor
But at least some of this was expected. To some degree, the reopening of the economy was bound to have a “coiled spring” effect on demand, but with supply still coming online after a lengthy shutdown, it’s a mismatch that could be transitory. It’s kind of like those looking to buy gas on the East Coast. Though the pipeline has been restarted, it will be a little while before the local markets stabilize.
Despite the selling this week, it’s worth remembering that we’ve seen record highs recently, so stocks were probably due for a bit of a pullback. Some of the selling in recent weeks has been cushioned by a buy-the-dip mentality in tech stocks. While that seems like it may be the case again today, we’ll have to see if investors keep turning to that playbook.
In corporate news, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) made a U-turn on bitcoin. The electric vehicle maker has stopped accepting the cryptocurrency for automobile purchases out of concern about “rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions,” according to a tweet from CEO Elon Musk.
He said the company won’t be selling any of its bitcoin holdings and would use it for transactions “as soon as mining transitions to more sustainable energy.” Nevertheless, bitcoin was down more than 7% this morning, and other cryptocurrencies appeared to be falling in sympathy, despite Musk saying cryptocurrency is a “good idea” that “has a promising future” and adding that Tesla is looking at cryptocurrencies besides bitcoin that use less than 1% of bitcoin’s energy per transaction.

Takeaways From 13F Season: Investors who follow particular fund managers can easily look up what each was buying and selling in the quarter, but other investors may be more interested in overall themes from 13F filings. The first quarter of 2021 was a big quarter for the S&P 500, and investors were likely interested in what top managers were buying and selling to kick off 2021.

Google parent Alphabet has the attention of fund managers, with Tepper selling and Soros and Klarman buying.
ViacomCBS had a volatile quarter in part due to the unwinding of Archegos Capital, and fund managers took notice. Tepper and Soros were buying, while Klarman was selling.
Buffett continued selling financial stocks and drug stocks and reversed course by selling Chevron just one quarter after taking a stake in the oil giant.
Several fund managers traded ETFs to play particular themes. Despite inflation fears, Einhorn sold the GLD gold fund while Soros reduced his exposure to emerging markets by selling the EEM fund.

Here’s a rundown of how the smart money was playing some of the most popular stocks last quarter.

The bill contains suggestions for a more “health-centered approach” and proposes reinvestment in alternative approaches, among many other important provisions.  
“Every 23 seconds, a person’s life is ruined for simply possessing drugs,” said Queen Adesuyi, policy manager for National Affairs at the Drug Policy Alliance (DPA). “Drug possession remains the most arrested offense in the United States despite the well-known fact that drug criminalization does nothing to help communities, it ruins them. It tears families apart and causes trauma that can be felt for generations. The drug war has caused mass devastation to Black, Latinx, Indigenous and low-income communities and today we say, ‘Enough is enough!’”
In Maine, lawmakers approved a similar bill to decriminalize all drugs on Friday.
Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards signed off on House Bill 652 to decriminalize small amounts of cannabis possession for personal use.
Possession of up to 14 grams will now be categorized as a misdemeanor rather than a felony. Those caught violating the law face up to a $100 fine without jail time.
Connecticut is on the verge of becoming the latest state to legalize marijuana for adult use, after lawmakers finally sent a cannabis reform bill to Gov. Ned Lamont’s desk on Thursday morning, the 50th anniversary of President Richard Nixon’s declaration of the war on drugs.
Gov. Lamont, who previously threatened to veto it over the eleventh-hour amendment, is now expected to sign the bill that will legalize the use and possession of up to 1.5 ounces of cannabis by adults 21 and older as of July 1. However, the launch of commercial cannabis sales is not expected to begin until May 2022.
Cannabis stocks traded down, underperforming general markets. Over the five trading days of this week:

In the business world, cannabis tech firm WM Holding Company, LLC (NASDAQ: MAPS), known for its Weedmaps brand, started trading on the Nasdaq, following a merger with investment management firm Silver Spike Acquisition Corp (NASDAQ: SSPK). 
Southern Glazer's Wine & Spirits, one of the top 15 alcohol distributors in the U.S. will soon offer Marley CBD beverages and confections, Benzinga learned exclusively ahead of an official announcement.
The deal between cannabis company Docklight Brands and Southern Glazer's will originally span across 7 states. The latter will leverage its 42 distribution centers, 14.8 million square feet of warehouse space and fleet of more than 2,600 delivery trucks, to make sure Marley CBD products reach as many consumers as possible.
The companies assure more states will be added in the coming months.
Policy, Science, Data And Advocacy
With cannabis being legal in some form in 47 states and with federal legalization just around the corner, the National Cannabis Industry Association (NCIA) released a summary of scientific, historical and medical uses of cannabis designed to inform policymakers and medical professionals.
Rhode Island's Senate Judiciary Committee approved an adult-use cannabis bill, marking the first time a cannabis proposal of its nature has ever reached the state General Assembly floor.
California is injecting $100 million into the state's struggling legal cannabis industry.
A new measure, proposed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, was approved by the California Legislature on Monday and aims to help legal cannabis operators acquire permanent licenses.
According to Newsom’s office, about 82% of the state’s legal operators still hold provisional licenses as of April 2021. These provisional licenses are due on Jan. 1, 2022.
Viola cannabis brand, launched by NBA veteran Al Harrington and named after his grandmother, announced on Wednesday that it has a new incubator partner - Mezz Brands.

The volatility seen in the broader market was largely a function of the swings in technology stocks, especially the big ones.
Here's a look at how the high-profile tech stocks going by the moniker ""FAANG"" fared during the volatile period:
Broader Market's ""Up-down-up"" Move:  The S&P 500, which is a considered a broader gauge of overall market performance, closed 2020 just shy of its all-high. Subsequently, the index experienced some volatility and was largely rangebound.

In a blog posting, Dowden announced his intention to publish a white paper in the autumn that would redefine the state of U.K. broadcasting.

Here is a look at some of the new and updated details from the company’s merger and remaining company.
The event included more than 100 slides, over three hours of content and a Q&A session.
Ackman On The SPAC Deal's Complex Structure: Ackman did his best to answer questions on the complex structure of the SPAC merger.
“We are willing to accept a high degree of situational, legal and/or capital structure complexity in a business combination if we believe that the potential for reward justifies this additional complexity, particularly if these issues can be resolved in connection with and as a result of a combination with us,” PSTH said in its 2020 prospectus.
The transaction was broken down in several slides. The total distribution will be determined by the share redemptions and warrant exchanges. The current rate is .643, which means an investor would receive 64 UMG shares for each 100 PSTH shares owned.
Fractional UMG shares will be paid in cash.
“As people understand this transaction, I believe it will trade at even higher premiums than ever before,” Ackman said.

Even with low volume, the markets didn't react much to economic news, such as initial jobless claims at a new pandemic low, and even to the overall strong employment numbers released on Friday.

However, common sense might suggest the story has no legs.
Who Says What: ViacomCBS stock popped Monday afternoon after Gasparino tweeted, “BREAKING: Biggest takeaway from the #SunValley Allen & Co conference: Shari Redstone made it clear she's shopping @ViacomCBS and not just to @comcast.”
He followed up with an appearance on his network that Redstone's actions ""could lay the groundwork"" to ViacomCBS to be merged with Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA), however, he also hedged himself by noting there were no ""merger meetings"" at the conference.
Gasparino's claim stands out from other major media focused on the event, who did not report that Redstone, the company’s chairwoman, “made it clear” that the company was up for sale. 
A July 8 article in the New York Post carrying the headline “Tongues wagging over Shari Redstone meeting with Comcast” reported Comcast CEO Brian Roberts briefly met with Redstone during the Allen & Co. conference in Idaho.

Two analysts raised their price targets for Netflix’s stock with UBS raising the target from $600 to $620 and Mizuho raising the price target from $710 to $900.
Netflix will kick off big tech earnings next week and traders and investors will be watching to see if the streaming service company can re-accelerate its subscriber growth for the second quarter.
When the company printed its first-quarter earnings on April 20, Netflix reported revenue of $7.16 billion which beat consensus estimates of $7.13 billion and earnings per share of $3.75, 26% above the consensus estimate of $2.96. The stock gapped down over 7% the day, however, after Netflix reported 208 million paid subscribers, which missed its guidance of 210 million.

In the short-term the Fed is still the girl everyone wants to dance with.
Lately, you can almost guess where stocks are going just by checking the 10-year Treasury yield, which often moves on perceptions of what the Fed might have up its sleeve. The yield bounced back from lows this morning to around 1.32%, and stock indices climbed a bit in pre-market trading. That was a switch from yesterday when yields fell and stocks followed suit. Still, yields are down about six basis points since Monday, and stocks are also facing a losing week.
It’s unclear how long this close tracking of yields might last, but maybe a big flood of earnings due next week could give stocks a chance to act more on fundamental corporate news instead of the back and forth in fixed income.
Meanwhile, retail sales for June this morning basically blew Wall Street’s conservative estimates out of the water, and stock indices edged up in pre-market trading after the data.
Headline retail sales rose 0.6% compared with the consensus expectation for a 0.6% decline, and with automobiles stripped out, the report looked even stronger, up 1.3% vs. expectations for 0.3%. Those numbers are incredibly strong and show the difficulty analysts are having in this market.  The estimates missed consumer strength by a long shot. However, it’s also possible this is a blip in the data that might get smoothed out with July’s numbers. We’ll have to wait and see.
Caution Flag Keeps Waving
Yesterday continued what feels like a “risk-off” pattern that began taking hold earlier in the week, but this time Tech got caught up in the selling, too. In fact, Tech was the second-worst performing sector of the day behind Energy, which continues to tank on ideas more crude could flow soon thanks to OPEC’s agreement.
We already saw investors embracing fixed income and “defensive” sectors starting Tuesday, and Thursday continued the trend. When your leading sectors are Utilities, Staples, Real Estate, the way they were yesterday, that really suggests the surging bond market’s message to stocks is getting read loudly and clearly.
This week’s decline in rates also isn’t necessarily happy news for Financial companies. That being said, the Financials fared pretty well yesterday, with some of them coming back after an early drop. It was an impressive performance and we’ll see if it can spill over into Friday.
Energy helped fuel the rally earlier this year, but it’s struggling under the weight of falling crude prices. Softness in crude isn’t guaranteed to last—and prices of $70 a barrel aren’t historically cheap—but crude’s inability to consistently hold $75 speaks a lot. Technically, the strength just seems to fade up there. Crude is up slightly this morning but still below $72 a barrel.
Losing Steam?
All of the FAANGs lost ground yesterday after a nice rally earlier in the week. Another key Tech name, chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), got taken to the cleaners with a 4.4% decline despite a major analyst price target increase to $900. NVDA has been on an incredible roll most of the year.

Why It Matters: Bloomberg reported that Netflix tapped former Facebook, Inc (NASDAQ: FB) AR/VR and Electronic Arts, Inc. (NASDAQ: EA) executive Mike Verdu to direct its video game efforts.
This marks an official strategic expansion into the industry following the release of its first mobile game in 2019, which was based on its award-winning series ""Stranger Things.""

“This is playing out as expected, with demand for these segments outpacing supply,” Munster said in a note.

Wall Street continues to show signs of tracking the bond market, and bond yields posted fresh five-month lows this morning.
Daily cases have tripled from a month ago in the U.S., and travel stocks are taking it on the chin today in pre-market trading. Airlines, hotels, casinos, and restaurants all could receive the brunt of the blow if Covid worries keep growing. Other companies aren’t immune. The outbreak is generally worse overseas, which could threaten business for multinational U.S. firms. Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) and General Motors (NYSE: GM) both slid ahead of the bell. 
As Covid concerns return to Page 1 of the morning news, we might see the return of one of last year’s trends, where markets settle down during the middle of the week but fear creeps in by the end of the week and into the weekend. On Friday the major indices closed on their lows—typically a bad sign from a technical standpoint—and like many weeks during the height of the pandemic, Friday’s weakness carried over into the new week.  
Eyeing The Horsemen Of Risk
The 10-year Treasury yield fell below 1.25% to new five-month lows early Monday. Crude fell below $70 a barrel for the first time since June 11. Part of the crude weakness might reflect the OPEC+ deal reached over the weekend, but it also could suggest fears of a slowing economy if the pandemic stays front and center. 
Keep an eye on volatility, too. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) put on some steam late last week and that spilled over into Monday. It’s back above 21 this morning, a move that’s probably going to get some notice. A higher VIX often can signal people taking protection against possible market turbulence. 
Weirdly, the dollar is rising here even as bond yields fall. This could reflect people thinking the U.S. is being hit less hard by this fresh Covid outbreak. 
As Monday continues, we’ll see if the market action here is one of those things where weekend fears lead to an initial reaction and then cooler heads prevail, or if concerns continue to weigh. The “buy the dip” mentality has been so strong lately, it’s hard to believe it would suddenly fade. The question is, at what level does it happen? The 4280 level in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) could be an important one to watch. 
What’s On The Earnings Tap?
Oddly, earnings seem almost like a second-tier story today even though we’re heading into the thick of the season with 76 S&P 500 companies reporting. Things kick off with Big Blue, IBM (NYSE: IBM) expected to report this afternoon. 
A host of other big names step to the plate this week including Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), American Express (NYSE: AXP), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), Twitter (NYSE: TWTR), United Airlines (NASDAQ: UAL), AT&T (NYSE: T), Verizon (NYSE: VZ), American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL), and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). 
Something to consider as these companies report is the impact of rising producer prices, and whether this could be clipping margins or causing them to pass along costs to consumers. Reopening is also in focus, so listen for executives’ thoughts on how that’s going.

The Delta variant raised questions about the strength of the recovery, and stocks that stood to benefit most from an economic revival—including travel firms—received the hardest blow.
At the same time, falling interest rates helped knock the Financial sector deep into the red, and a 7% collapse in crude prices (see chart below) slammed the brakes on Energy stocks. Both sectors had already been under pressure over the last month, but Monday was the steepest plunge yet, with Energy falling nearly 4% and Financials dropping 3%.

CHART OF THE DAY: OIL’S SLIPPERY SLOPE. Crude oil futures (/CL—candlestick) fell to their 100-day simple moving average (blue line) at $66.21 per barrel, which coincides with a previous resistance-turned-support level of around $66. Data source: CME Group. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  
Defensive sectors like Staples, Real Estate, and Health Care also took a beating, but not as badly as the reopening and cyclical parts of the market. At the same time, strength could be found in a few of the well-known Tech firms like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). They all traded in the green even as the broader indices got slammed, perhaps in hope that Tech could outperform other sectors if this slowdown continues. That would echo what we saw last year when the pandemic first shocked the markets. 
Another echo is how some of the buying and selling shaped up across other sectors. Payment processing companies saw their stocks fall sharply on worries about consumer demand getting clipped, but grocery store stocks were among the leaders today, perhaps amid thoughts that people might drive to stores to load up on staples. We saw that kind of bifurcation back in March 2020, as well. 
On a positive note, some of the selling dried up in the final minutes of the session and major indices finished off their lows. This could be a positive going into tomorrow, but consider monitoring the futures market tonight and tomorrow morning to see if selling returns. 
Importantly, the S&P 500 Index (SPX) managed to come back from below its 50-day moving average to close solidly above that level. This suggests that maybe the “buy the dip” mentality that’s characterized the market so much in 2021 hasn’t vanished.

Early on, it looks like they might get their wish. Major indices rebounded overnight after the worst day in 10 months, with some of the “reopening” stocks that got pounded yesterday showing signs of a “turnaround Tuesday.” The key could end up being what happens after the first 30 minutes of trading. Spillover from the overnight session may carry things higher at first, but then we’ll see if there’s any continued momentum for the rest of the day. 
Two of the factors that helped lead things down yesterday popped up just a bit this morning, which may be why stocks turned green in pre-market trading. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed a fraction but remains below 1.2%, and crude oil also made a tiny move higher but is still trading below $67 a barrel. Weakness in yields and crude yesterday were seen by some as signals of possible slowing economic growth. 
It also helps to see Big Blue—IBM (NYSE: IBM)—reporting a strong quarter after the close yesterday. The company beat analysts’ estimates on top- and bottom-lines, and the CEO said IBM sees continued signs of strength in the cloud market and customer demand. Shares are up more than 3% in the pre-market. Travelers (NYSE: TRV) also had a good quarter and saw shares rebound, which may be sending positive vibes.
As we’ve talked about before, the “buy the dip” mentality appears to remain in place. People, like sports teams, tend to keep running the play that’s been working, and lately, it’s worked a lot. We’ll see if it picks up some momentum. But remember: past isn’t prologue, and complacency and trading are like oil and water. 
Volatility, Delta Variant, Earnings Among Things to Watch
After a day like yesterday it’s arguably fair to say we’re far from out of the woods. First of all, when the market takes a smack in the face like that there are often reverberations for days or even weeks. Volatility is a little lower this morning, but the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is still above 21 after falling into the mid-teens recently. Anything above 20 could signal worries of turbulence ahead, though it’s probably constructive that VIX never got anywhere near 30 yesterday. 
Also, the Delta variant of Covid—which appeared to help trigger much of yesterday’s selling by speculators—hasn’t gone anywhere. Yesterday’s U.S. caseload was the highest daily count since early May, according to media reports. Major indices fell in Asia overnight but rose in Europe. 
Earnings season officially started last week, but will accelerate in the days to come. This afternoon and tomorrow morning are expected to bring results from Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), United Airlines (NASDAQ: UAL), and Chipotle (NYSE: CMG), among others. Those three could give investors a well-rounded look into how factors like higher prices, the Delta variant, and reopening are playing into consumer preferences. With Netflix, ...","['News', 'Earnings', 'Government', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Regulations', 'Guidance', 'Retail Sales', 'Restaurants', 'IPOs', 'Global', 'Markets', 'Tech', 'Media', 'General']",0.79477,Neutral,https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/22062639

Whether looking to buy outrights Calls or Puts, or to reduce capital outlay through Spreads, the expected move can be a valuable tool in both strategy and strike selection. Below, we’ll look at several trades that incorporate the expected move, using Netflix earnings and options expiring this Friday to illustrate.

Debit Spreads
For instance, a Call Spread to the expected move might be used by a trader positioning for a stock move in line with options market expectations. Buying higher probability at or near-the-money Calls while simultaneously selling lower probability Calls at or beyond the expected move.
Here’s an example: a +535/-565 Debit Call Spread with NFLX trading around $535. It costs around $10, and can make up to $20 if the stock is at or above $565 on Friday. It buys the $535 call for around $15, while simultaneously selling a $5 call at the expected move, for a net debit of $10.
That’s less expensive than buying the 535 Call outright, along with higher probability of profit (based on its breakeven of $545). Here’s how the trade looks on an Options AI stock chart.

In fact, the major indices are basically back where they were Friday after two crazy days, making it look like Monday and Tuesday never happened. 
The latest positive reports came from Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), Verizon (NYSE: VZ), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), and Chipotle (NYSE: CMG), all of which beat analysts’ estimates for Q2 results and are pushing higher in pre-market trading. Both KO and JNJ raised guidance, as well, with stadiums and movie theaters back for KO and medical devices and drug sales helping JNJ. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) components continue to come in strong on the earnings front, and we’ll see if the market can build on this today. 
The only earnings disappointment last night and this morning came from Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), whose estimates for future subscriber growth came in below the Street’s projections. Shares fell 1% ahead of the open. It’s also a slight disappointment to see the major indices losing some of the ground they gained overnight ahead of the open, as the Nasdaq (COMP: GIDS) actually fell slightly into the red. We’ve gone from a strong overnight rally to kind of mixed heading into the open, but the S&P 500 Index’s (SPX) bounce off the 50-day moving average yesterday could potentially continue to provide technical support on any downturns. 
Two key metrics that flopped on Monday and dragged stocks down with them—the 10-year yield and crude—both edged a bit higher this morning, also adding to the positive tone. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is back below 20 this morning, but there’s no reason not to expect volatility to continue after what the market just went through. The question remains what’s going on with inflation, and that’s the primary reason for all the shakiness lately. 
Data’s a bit thin this week, and yesterday’s housing numbers presented a mixed picture for June. Housing starts came in above Wall Street’s expectations, but building permits—often seen as a leading indicator—declined across all parts of the country. This could reflect rising costs for labor and building materials, among other things. 
Tomorrow brings weekly initial jobless claims data. Analysts look for a headline of 360,000, equal to a week earlier, according to research firm Briefing.com. 
Before that, we’ll get a look at earnings from Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN), CSX (NASDAQ: CSX), and Whirlpool (NYSE: WHR), all of which are expected to report after the close today. The CSX and WHR reports could give investors a sense of consumer health, while TXN provides a look at the semiconductor market.
Momentum Check
One question investors had going into Tuesday was whether major indices could hold onto pre-market gains past the first half-hour of the session and help stamp out unpleasant memories of Monday’s fierce selloff.
They got the answer eight hours later after the SPX climbed 1.5% to nearly gain back what it lost Monday. The fact that the SPX was able to bounce off its 50-day moving average near 4240 after falling briefly below it on Monday arguably played a role, because ...","['News', 'Earnings', 'Guidance', 'Commodities', 'Retail Sales', 'Global', 'Markets', 'Tech', 'General']",1.0,Positive,https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/22083759

Last week's bullish calls included the iPhone maker, a top oilfield services stock and a pharmaceutical giant.
FAANG stocks, the top cryptocurrency and meme stocks were among the bearish calls seen.

After a shaky start, the markets bounced back this past week from the prior week's dip into the red. The Nasdaq led the big U.S. indexes with an almost 3% gain for the week, while the S&P 500 was up about 2% and Dow Jones industrial average about 1% higher.
COVID-19 has been creeping back into the headlines, partly due to the Tokyo Olympics. That has prompted fears that the economic recovery might stumble. Both crude prices and Bitcoin slumped during the week, while chip shortages and inflation remained. The brewing debt ceiling fight in Congress is only just getting started.
However, the earnings-reporting season ramped up this week as well, and strong results from Dow Jones industrials helped buoy the markets. While the first FAANG component to post results disappointed, other strong tech sector reports have increased the high expectations for the coming week's results from the iPhone maker and market darling.

The next few days include earnings from four of the five “FAANG” companies and one-third of the S&P 500 overall. There’s also a Fed meeting, and Congress could be making progress on an infrastructure bill. Get ready for possible volatility amid all this news. 
Last week featured an amazing turnaround that really helped demonstrate the resilience of this market. If someone had told you after Monday’s selloff that we’d end up being higher for the week with indices back at record levels, you might have thought they were crazy. But that’s what happened, and the market seemed to gather more strength going into Friday’s close. 
What’s driving this? It’s probably earnings, at least to some extent. And we’re about to start one of the biggest earnings weeks of the quarter featuring 180 of the companies in the S&P 500 and one-third of the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) components, so don’t touch your dial. 
Major indices rose four sessions in a row through Friday but turned lower in overnight trading heading into the new week. Pressure from losses in Asia might be a  factor. It’s also a bit worrisome to see the 10-year Treasury yield fall back below 1.25% in the early going after flirting with 1.3% on Friday. Weaker yields sometimes suggest concerns about economic growth.
Nearly 90% of Companies Beating Street’s Earnings Estimates
By Friday, 24% of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported results for Q2. Of these, 88% reported EPS above consensus estimates, FactSet said. That compares to the five-year average of 75%. 
Earnings estimates for the quarter as a whole are on their way up, too, with FactSet now estimating Q2 earnings growth of 74.2%, compared with its previous estimate of 69.4%. Positive earnings surprises reported by companies in multiple sectors (led by the Financials, Health Care, Information Technology, and Communication Services sectors) led to improvement in the overall earnings estimate over the past week, FactSet said. 
This week’s calendar is packed. Some of the major companies expected to report include Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Leaving TSLA aside, that’s quite a mouthful of FAANGs. Microsoft (MSFT), sometimes thought of as an honorary FAANG, is also on the calendar. 
Financials and a lot of the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) stocks started earnings off with a good tone, but you could argue that the real heavyweight fight begins this week with the AAPLs and the MSFTs. They likely need to come through with solid results to keep this rally going. 
What’s a little unclear is how much of a role Treasury yields are playing. They initially bulked up early last week after falling sharply on Monday, but then they just couldn’t keep up the pace with stocks and ended Friday at 1.28% for the benchmark 10-year yield. The 1.3% level looks like a key one and it didn’t get seriously tested much despite the stock market rally. 
This morning’s weakness in yields might hurt Financial stocks, but big banks have done a good job of controlling expenses and generating ...","['News', 'Earnings', 'Government', 'Regulations', 'Guidance', 'Commodities', 'Retail Sales', 'Restaurants', 'IPOs', 'Federal Reserve', 'Markets', 'Tech', 'General']",1.0,Neutral,https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/22150558

But this fairy tale isn’t over quite yet. There doesn’t seem to be enough magic in the world to totally do away with the pandemic that blew the park earnings last year, threatens this year, and may continue reliance on streaming again this year.
The good news is the quarterly year-over-year comparisons will provide a kinder backdrop to fiscal Q3 earnings when they’re released Thursday after the market closes. Analysts are widely expecting revenues will jump 43%, thanks to the re-openings of theme parks and entertainment segments whose mandated closings pushed results off a cliff last year.
Sales are expected to hit $16.8 billion, compared with $11.78 billion a year ago, a chunk of that fueled by the success of Disney+. Earnings per share are forecasted to reach $0.55, well ahead of last year’s adjusted $0.08 cents.
The stock hit an all-time high of $203 in mid-March and has given back about 13% of that since underperforming the S&P 500 Index (SPX). The results could move the stock in either direction. JP Morgan (NYSE: JPM), for one, remains confident about the stock and sees a dip as a buying opportunity.
“With its continued digital transformation and recovery at the legacy business, Disney remains our top pick in media in 2021,” JPM analysts said in a recent note.

FIGURE 1: DISNEY VS. SPX. Disney’s stock price (DIS—candlestick) hit a high in mid-March but has pulled back since then. It has underperformed the S&P 500 Index (SPX—purple line) since May.

How Long Are Lines At Theme Parks?
Investors are likely interested in how attendance is at the theme parks since the re-openings, given the new rules, tweaked loyalty programs, and mask requirements. Social media tells many a story of stretched lines and frustrating waiting times—one tweet included a picture of a long, long line at a Space Mountain attraction, snaking around Tomorrowland.
But let’s not forget that capacity is still not at full-house levels. And, really, when were lines ever short and fast at any Disney park?
Beyond that, it might be interesting to hear how the parks are responding to the Delta variant in areas like Orange County, Florida, which has seen its virus positivity rates jump back into double digits.
Published reports have noted that while the cases are again on the rise and ICU units are again full, the local theme parks have not readjusted safety procedures to what ...","['News', 'Earnings', 'Guidance', 'Options', 'Travel', 'Markets', 'Tech', 'Media', 'General']",0.94418,Neutral,https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/22428119

Takeaways From 13F Season: Investors who follow particular fund managers can easily look up what each was buying and selling in the quarter, but other investors may be more interested in overall themes from 13F filings. The second quarter of 2021 was another big quarter for the S&P 500, and investors were likely interested in what top managers were buying and selling heading into the second half of 2021.

Google parent Alphabet has the attention of fund managers, with Tepper selling and Soros buying.
Alibaba had a brutal quarter in part due to a regulatory crackdown on big tech stocks in China, and fund managers took notice. Tepper was selling while Cooperman was buying the dip.
Buffett continued accumulating Kroger shares while selling off health care investments.
Several fund managers traded ETFs to play particular themes. Despite a booming U.S. Market, Cooperman invested in developed markets outside of the U.S. & Canada by buying the EFA ETF, while Smith made big bets on small and mid-cap stocks by buying the IWR and IWM funds.

Here’s a rundown of how the smart money was playing some of the most popular stocks last quarter.

The Disney Chart: Disney’s stock has been trading in a symmetrical triangle since April 5. On Aug. 13, the stock attempted to break up bullishly from the triangle but ran into a group of sellers at a resistance level near the $187 mark and closed the day back down under the upper descending trendline of the pattern. On Thursday Disney’s stock tested support at the ascending trendline of the triangle and held above it indicating the pattern is recognized.
If Disney closes the trading day near the $174 level, it will print a doji candlestick on the daily chart. When a doji candle is printed at the bottom of a downtrend it often signals a reversal to the upside is in the cards.
Disney is trading below the eight-day and 21-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) with the eight-day EMA trending below the 21-day, both of which are bearish indicators.

Thursday was the most recent example. Yesterday’s rally after a steep early drop was really impressive as the “buy the dip” mentality lives on. There’s no way else to explain it. It’s the same trend seen most of the year, and this time it came despite worries about Fed policy, the Delta variant, and a slowdown in China. 
That’s not to say it’s going to necessarily keep happening. Only that so far, bets against this market haven’t paid off, for the most part.
Stellar Earnings Parade Continues Even As Season Winds Down
One reason for the resilience in face of so many challenges is a healthy earnings background. In the long run, the market runs on earnings, and we’re wrapping up one of the best earnings seasons in history. 
For a coda, FootLocker (NYSE: FL) shares are up almost 9% in pre-market trading today after the company reported what Barron’s called “out of this world” earnings. The footwear company more than doubled Wall Street analysts’ expectations for the bottom line and posted a nearly 7% rise in comparable-store sales. 
Also this morning, Deere (NYSE: DE) is on the rise. The company beat analysts’ top- and bottom-line estimates and raised guidance. DE is an important barometer of the global economy because it has its hands in several key industries including agriculture, forestry, and construction. That’s why it’s good to hear DE pointing to “favorable fundamentals” when there’s so much hand-wringing about economic growth. 
Another thing that’s gotten some hand-wringing is inflation, but with crude down near $62 a barrel from highs of $76 earlier this year, one aspect of price pressure seems to be receding. 
Having said that, we’re far from out of the woods. Stock indices were lower this morning and volatility is up nearly to yesterday’s highs. Today’s an options expiration day, too, which may fuel some of the volatility. Trading could lack conviction the next few days ahead of the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium because no one knows what the Fed is going to do. 
Stretched But Not Broken
If it sometimes feels like the stock market is playing with a net, maybe that’s because of days like Thursday. 
Once again, an ugly overnight session and early losses mellowed out pretty nicely across the course of the day, allowing the S&P 500 Index (SPX) to finish with very slight gains. The “net,” so to speak, appears to be that same 50-day moving average that’s been there on every decline over the last six months. 
Right now, the 50-day moving average sits just below 4350 for the SPX. The index approached within 10 points of that at its lows yesterday but couldn’t find more selling interest. Instead, buyers seemed to come back in, just as they have each time the index tested that technical level on mid-month selloffs in July, June, and May. 
Don’t let that make you complacent, however. The market hasn’t had a formal correction (defined as a drop of 10% or more) since last year when the pandemic first surged. History suggests that corrections are pretty typical, and we’ve had a bunch over the last five years. That means some might say we’re overdue, though it’s not written in stone that corrections have to happen. 
Also, having a few “mega-cap” stocks perform well yesterday helped mask the fact that declining issues far outpaced gainers on both the SPX and Nasdaq. Don’t forget how the ...","['News', 'Earnings', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Guidance', 'Futures', 'Commodities', 'Retail Sales', 'Global', 'Federal Reserve', 'Markets', 'Tech', 'General']",1.0,Negative,https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/22594985

Ball is a partner in the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSE: META), which began trading earlier this year.
Netflix And Video Games: While Netflix getting into video games has been rumored for years, the talk really heated up this year when the company offered hints during an earnings call in April.
Ball has argued for Netflix to get into video games dating back to 2018, when he said it was unlikely the streaming giant would pursue live sports or live news, but a launch into gaming “felt inevitable given the company’s culture and growing scale.”
Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said in 2018 that ""Fortnite"" was the company’s biggest competition. The statement came 41 days after Ball tweeted a similar thought about a competition for entertainment time.
Why Netflix Is Getting Into Games: Ultimately, Netflix’s entry into the game is more about leisure time than money, Ball argues.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) announced  Thursday new App store rules, marking the second refinement in 10 months. The 30% in-app take rate for large developers and 15% take rate for small developers remained unchanged.
Windfall For Small App Developers:  Apple's recent App store policy change will likely benefit small developers, given they otherwise are less likely to have a way to contact their users, Loup Funds Managing Partner Gene Munster  said in a note.
Large developers such as Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Spotify Technology SA (NYSE: SPOT) have already stepped away from Apple, prohibiting new users to sign up inside the App Store, the analyst said.
""Win-win"" For All Stakeholders:  The changes announced do not allow developers to advertise within their apps about alternative payment options, the analyst said.
""This is a moderation, not an elimination, of the anti-steering clause,"" he added.
Apple's adjustment, according to the analyst, is a win-win-win for all three parties – Apple, app makers and lawmakers.

But more often than not, these projects never find their way to the big screen. This situation is commonly known as “development hell.”
Occasionally, a film that languished for years or even decades in development hell somehow manages to escape and get made. One of the most recent notable examples is Martin Scorsese’s “The Irishman,” which was conceived in the 1980s and went into development in 2007 but wasn’t ready for release until 2019 via Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX).
While running a complete inventory of every project locked in development hell could easily overwhelm our bandwidth, here are five projects that had all the right boxes checked but were never called before the cameras.
“Akira”: Katsuhiro Otomo’s feature film is widely considered to be among the greatest anime productions in the genre's history. Warner Bros. acquired the rights for a live-action remake and Otomo graciously stepped back and voiced his approval for any necessary story changes that would be needed for the new version.
To date, however, “Akira” has baffled screenwriters and directors eager to recreate its sci-fi noir brilliance. Filmmakers including George Miller, Justin Lin, Christopher Nolan and Jordan Peele were cited as being courted for the project. In 2019, Taika Waititi announced he would helm “Akira” for release in the summer of 2021, but he put that work on indefinite hold to concentrate on ""Thor: Love and Thunder.""
The Chance of the Film Getting Made: It is possible, especially since Netflix is backing another anime-inspired project, the series “Cowboy Bebop,” and Waititi has insisted he is still focused on getting “Akira” made.

Profit takers likely came in due to the stock’s relative strength index (RSI) measuring in at about 82%.
Relative strength index is a popular momentum oscillator that measures the magnitude of price momentum. When a security’s RSI measures over 70%, it's considered to be in overbought territory, which is a sell signal for technical traders.
Virtus Investment Partners' Joe Terranova said on Wednesday he planned to play the stock’s momentum and said Netflix was setting up to break to a new all-time high. Terranova predicts the stock could reach $625 or even $650.
On Thursday options traders began hammering Netflix call contracts and together bet over $2.54 million the stock would trade higher. Netflix may need some consolidation to cool its RSI down before another run but institutions must not see the stock retracing significantly any time soon because there were no notable put contracts purchased.

Why It’s Important: When a sweep order occurs, it indicates the trader wanted to get into a position quickly and is anticipating an imminent large move in stock price. A sweeper pays market price for the call or put option instead of placing a bid, which sweeps the order book of multiple exchanges to fill the order immediately.

Major indices headed lower again overnight as the mood seems to remain cautious. Treasury yields fell ahead of a series of auctions that could help us get a sense of how much demand is out there for U.S. debt. 
Overseas, meanwhile, the European Central Bank kept rates unchanged but decided to dial back its emergency bond purchases, Reuters reported. The ECB has been buying 80 billion euros of debt each month, and some analysts expect that to fall by 10 billion to 20 billion euros. 
While there’s no way to know what this might mean for Fed policy, central banks around the world have been known to work in sync at times. It’s kind of interesting to see European stocks trim some of their earlier losses this morning following the ECB’s move, though it’s way too early to draw any conclusions about the market reaction. One idea is that investors might see slowing bond purchases by central banks as evidence the economy is in a better place. 
In the U.S., the Treasury market didn’t appear to show many reactions to the ECB move. The 10-year yield moved down a couple of basis points to near 1.33%.
Featureless Trading A Feature
The stock market these days might remind some people of that old story about the emperor’s new suit. Everyone acts like they see something there, but there really isn’t much to look at. 
We’ve had three days in a row of S&P 500 Index (SPX) losses, and the Nasdaq (COMP: GIDS) had its win streak broken yesterday. There doesn’t seem to be any real direction now, and no real spark to the upside. 
The string of losses followed last week’s disappointing U.S. jobs growth data from the government, but some analysts say the softness reflects a growing belief that the Fed could start tapering stimulus. Traditionally, the Fed has tapered when the economy does better, but much of the recent data including jobs, haven’t been too uplifting. So it’s unclear exactly what the Fed might do. Less clear than before the jobs report, arguably. 
Then we saw a couple of the biggest investment banks—Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS)—release bearish notes saying the Delta variant and slowing economic growth pose potential risks. MS thinks there could be a 10% to 15% pullback in stocks before the end of the year. 
There’s no way to know if MS is right, and it’s definitely true we haven’t seen even a 5% drop all year. That makes this one of the few recent years not to experience that big a pullback, and it has a lot of analysts wringing their hands. Also, September is historically a seasonally weak month. 
At the same time, indices continue to trade just below all-time highs. This means it could take a strong catalyst to encourage investors to jump in with more money.

What Happened: On Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2022, the best of movies and television were honored in a broadcast on NBC and Peacock, both units of Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA). The awards show had a strong presence from streaming companies, with several among the most nominated.
Two of the big winners came with ties to The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS). “Abbott Elementary,” which airs on ABC, won the Best Comedy television award. “The Banshees of Inisherin,” which came from Searchlight Pictures, won Best Picture for movies in the musical or comedy category.
Disney unit Marvel also set a record with actress Angela Bassett becoming the first Marvel actor to win a Golden Globe for their role. Marvel has had huge box office success with $11.1 billion in the domestic box office, but has been shut out of many awards shows. Bassett’s win was one of the few awards for any of the top-grossing movies of 2022.
HBO, a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD), was a big winner at the Golden Globes. The company got wins for Best Drama for Television with “House of the Dragon” and for Best Limited Series for Television with “The White Lotus.”

What Happened: HBO and HBO Max will premiere “The Last of Us,” a television adaptation of a bestselling video game, on Jan. 15, 2023. The debut comes shortly after HBO and HBO Max took home four wins and had 14 nominations, the most among streaming-related companies at the 2022 Golden Globes.
“The Last of Us” is based on the bestselling and award-winning video game from Naughty Dog, a unit of Sony Group Corp (NYSE: SONY). The game was released in 2013 and exclusive to consoles from Sony. A sequel released in 2020 was also among the bestselling video game titles in recent history and was widely praised.
Adapting a video game franchise into a movie or television series can be a difficult task and comes with risks and rewards with a built-in fan base that can love the idea and want to watch, or quickly turn and be upset that the content doesn’t follow the game.

(NYSE: GME).
Here’s a look back at what happened, what’s happened since and what could be next.
What Happened: Struggling video game retailer GameStop became the target of short sellers betting on a further decline or bankruptcy. Community support on the r/Wallstreetbets subreddit and other social media outlets led to an epic short squeeze story that dominated the headlines in early 2021 and throughout the year.
One of the places where the short squeeze story gained steam was on Benzinga’s “Power Hour” show, where Citron Research’s Andrew Left joined to share his thesis on why he was betting against GameStop.
On Jan. 21, Left was interviewed live and the video had thousands of messages in the chat defending GameStop’s future growth and why Left was wrong.
The stock rose on the day and over the next several days, leading the Benzinga interview to be one of the places considered as the “room where it happened.”
Two other central figures in the GameStop storyline were Ryan Cohen and Keith Patrick Gill. 
Cohen is the founder of Chewy Inc (NYSE: CHWY) and is now the chairman of the video game retailer. Cohen took a 9% stake in GameStop which was announced in August 2020 and increased his stake to 13% in 2021, becoming a hero figure for those rallying around GameStop.
Keith Patrick Gill, who went by the handle Roaring Kitty on YouTube and DeepF***ingValue on Reddit, placed a $56,000 bet on GameStop through call options and posted his research to YouTube and Reddit. Gill’s investment was worth tens of millions of dollars in January 2021.
Retail traders were drawn to GameStop thanks to research online and also as a way to take on hedge funds and those betting against the video game company.

A new filing revealed what the Pelosis sold from their investment portfolio in late 2022.
What Happened: After ranking as one of the top 10 trading members of Congress in 2021, Pelosi didn’t crack the top 10 in 2022 and saw a return of -19.8% according to a report that tracked Congress trading during the year. 
A new filing from Pelosi showed the couple’s portfolio sold several stocks at the end of 2022, in a move that may have come in tandem with the end of the year and tax loss harvesting.
Here is a look at the transactions disclosed by the Pelosis on Friday:

Sold $500,000 to $1,000,000 of AllianceBernstein Holding LP (NYSE: AB) on Dec. 28. Comments said the sale was 20,000 shares sold at an average price of $32.95 for a loss of $11,510.

As the earnings flow kickstarts in earnest in the unfolding week, here is Benzinga’s compilation of expectations and the key earnings reports to watch out for during the trading week: 
Q4 Sentiment Muted:  Fourth-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies are estimated to drop 3.9% year-over-year, financial data provider FactSet’s latest weekly “Earnings Insight” report shows. This marks a slight improvement from the 4.1% drop predicted in the firm’s previous weekly report.
If the prediction for negative earnings comes true, it would mark the first drop since the third quarter of 2020.
Twenty-nine of the S&P 500 companies have reported actual results, with 23 reporting earnings outperformance relative to estimates and 20 reporting upside revenue surprise.
Early Trends Give Hope:  Of the 29 earnings reports printed so far, 79% have reported better-than-expected earnings per share, and in aggregate actual earnings exceeded estimates by 7.7%, FactSet said.
At a very early stage, the number of companies reporting positive EPS surprises and the magnitude of these EPS surprises are trending close to their five-year averages, the report said.
The forward 12-month P/E ratio for the S&P 500 Index is at 17.3, according to FactSet, which is below the five-year average of 18.5 but above the 10-year average of 17.2.
It has also improved from 15.2 at the end of the third quarter, as the index has appreciated about 11.1%. The trailing 12-month P/E ratio is 19.4, below the five-year average of 22.7 and the 10-year average of 20.5.

The Netflix Thesis:  Among the streaming giant's key metrics, churn is returning to normal, gross adds continue to be challenged and viewership is mixed, Patterson said in a note previewing the company’s quarterly results.
Churn fell 0.2% month-over-month in December to 1.8%, in line with historical norms, suggesting the metric is returning to normal, the analyst said. Citing a 2% year-over-year decline in Google search queries globally and a 15% decline in app downloads, according to Apptopia, the analyst said the fourth quarter may have seen a softer gross add environment.

U.S. stocks ended Wednesday’s session sharply lower, reacting to another batch of negative economic data and hawkish Fed speeches. Even as producer prices retreated more than expected, separate reports showed worse-than-expected retail sales and industrial output data. Federal Reserve’s Beige Book also raised the specter of little growth in the months ahead.
Investors, who reacted positively to bad data for most of the past year, are apparently now more worried about growth than inflation.
The major averages opened higher and built up some early momentum only to lose ground in late-morning trading. They declined steadily through the rest of the session and ended near the lows of the session, with the Nasdaq Composite Index breaking a seven-session losing streak.
Consumer staple, utility, real estate, energy, financial, industrial and IT services stocks plunged in a session that saw a broad-based sell-off.

Key Banc Says Multiple Expansion Unlikely: Net paid adds were materially better than expected in Latin America but slightly below expectations in the U.S. and Canada, KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Justin Patterson  said. Fourth-quarter revenue was below KeyBanc’s estimate, he said, adding that the linearity may have contributed to the miss.
See Also: Best Communication Services Stocks
Dissecting the first-quarter guidance, Patterson noted that the company expects net paid adds to be moderately positive but below fourth-quarter levels. This, according to Patterson, was consistent with normal seasonality.
The revenue guidance of $8.17 billion has factored in some conservatism around both ad-supported revenue and the impact of the paid sharing, he said. The operating margin guidance trailed KeyBanc’s estimate, with the company suggesting the relatively soft number was due to the timing of content spend, he added.
Patterson said he wasn’t overly surprised at Hastings transitioning to executive chairmanship and Greg Peters'  elevation to the co-CEO's role. Product initiatives such as paid sharing and advertising, which are handled by Peters, are of strategic importance, Patterson said.

Several critical darlings received numerous nominations and many of the top nominated movies from the recent Golden Globes awards show also heard their names called again.
Two of the big questions from the nominations centered around the awards success of movies on streaming platforms and big box office movies.
The 95th Academy Awards will air on ABC on March 12.
Can Netflix Win The Big Award?: Streaming giant Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) had been an award favorite in recent years, and at the Golden Globes it recently won three awards from its 14 nominations.
Netflix was once again nominated for top honors in the Best Picture category with its “All Quiet on the Western Front,” a movie it acquired the rights to in 2020.
The anti-war German film is an adaptation of a 1929 novel and was also the subject of the award-winning 1930 film of the same name, which took home the Best Picture that year.
Netflix's “All Quiet on the Western Front” received nine total nominations, ranking as the second most nominated movie behind only the 10 for “Everything Everywhere All at Once.”
Netflix received a total of 15 nominations, which was among the best for streaming companies. Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS) had 22 total nominations, including 12 for titles related to its Disney+ streaming platform.
Last year, “CODA” took home the award for Best Picture, giving streaming platform AppleTV+ ...","['News', 'Entertainment', 'Top Stories', 'General']",0.96437,Negative,https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/30555092

What Happened: Streaming giant Netflix saw a massive hit in “Squid Game,” which was watched a record 1.65 billion hours by subscribers in the first 28 days of availability and hit number one in hundreds of countries.
“A mind-boggling 142 million member households globally have chosen to watch the title in its first four weeks,” the company said at the time.

Netflix announced it had a second season of the show coming and it would be releasing a reality show themed around the hit, titled “Squid Game: The Challenge.”
The reality series will have 456 people compete for a cash prize of $4.56 million.

Brady previously announced his retirement from the league in February 2022 before deciding one month later that he would return.
Brady said in his retirement video on social media on Wednesday that this time he is stepping away from playing ""for good."" 
Brady was the oldest player in the NFL for the 2022-2023 season. Drafted 199th overall in the 2000 NFL Draft on April 6, 2000, a lot has changed since Brady first entered the league.
Here’s a look at 23 things that weren’t around when Brady joined the NFL.
Cryptocurrency: Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) was founded in 2009, following a white paper released the previous year. The market capitalization of Bitcoin is more than $400 billion and one of many cryptocurrencies that are now readily available to trade by consumers, including on the FTX app endorsed by Brady.
Twitter: Social media platform Twitter Inc was founded in March 2006. Brady has 2.8 million followers on the social media platform as of today.
Facebook: Social media platform Facebook, which is owned by Meta Platforms inc (NASDAQ: META), was founded in 2004, two years after Brady joined the NFL.
Instagram: Photo and video sharing social media platform Instagram, which is owned by Meta Platforms, launched in 2010. Brady has more than 13 million followers on Instagram, but trails his ex-wife, model Gisele Bundchen at 20.5 million.
iPhone: Now one of the most popular smartphones in the world, the iPhone wasn’t launched until 2007 by Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL). Brady couldn’t own an iPhone until his eighth season in the NFL.
Netflix Streaming: Now used by hundreds of millions of people worldwide, the ability to stream movies and television shows from Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) wasn’t a reality when Brady joined the league. Netflix launched in 1998 as a DVD by mail service and would later add streaming in 2007.

The Analyst Takeaways: With CEO Iger returning to lead Disney, Loop Capital expected there to be an increased focus on cost savings and profitability. After the first quarter results, Gould said these efforts are “on steroids,” suggesting a more aggressive approach and quicker timeline.
“We anticipated $1.3 to $2.0 billion of cost-cutting; the company announced $5.5 billion-$3.0 billion of content and $2.5 billion of non-programming costs including 7,000 layoffs,” Gould said.
The analyst said when all the cost savings are fully factored in, it could bring an incremental $1.85 in earnings per share on top of estimates.
Gould also highlighted Disney eliminated guidance on Disney+ subscribers as it was “no longer chasing subs at all costs.”
The analyst saw a focus on cutting costs on content spending as conversative and noted programming costs were 88% of revenue for Disney+ in the quarter compared to 56% in the prior year and 45% for streaming rival Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX).
RBC Capital Markets' Maral saw a new chapter for Disney centered on “rationalizing its streaming business” with sustainable growth and profitability. The analyst called this plan “the bare necessities for a whole new world,” using well-known Disney songs.
“Key highlights include a strategic reorganization, a $5.5 billion cost savings plan, and a drastic evolution of the company’s DTC vision,” Maral said.

Gaming fits into the ETF management company’s thesis that time spent on games and digital goods could continue.
Here are the two gaming-related companies that are owned by Ark Invest in the ETFs and why the company sees them as the way to play the sector.
What Happened: Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood shared a thesis on investing in gaming companies Roblox Corp (NYSE: RBLX) and Unity Software (NYSE: U) in previous interviews and write-ups.
Ark portfolio manager Nick Grous added more details and gave an update to Benzinga as to why these two gaming-related stocks are the big bets Ark Invest is placing on the sector.
“If you look at the solution that Roblox offers, Roblox isn’t necessarily a video game publisher, it’s actually a video game platform,” Grous said.
The Ark Invest portfolio manager added vertical integration for a company such as Roblox is important when considering investments in the gaming space. Grous said Roblox is probably more similar to YouTube than it is to other video game publishers.
Like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)-owned YouTube, Roblox has user-generated experiences that drive the content, Grous said.
As an example, Grous highlighted within a week of “Squid Game” going viral on streaming platform Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX), ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['Gaming', 'Top Stories', 'Exclusives', 'After-Hours Center', 'Trading Ideas', 'Interview', 'General']",0.99982,Neutral,https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/30888919

Companies are looking for an edge with the release or original shows and movies, live sports and other exclusives.
Here’s a look at the latest from Paramount Global (NASDAQ: PARA) (NASDAQ: PARAA) and how it stacks up to rivals.
What Happened: Paramount Global reported revenue of $8.13 billion in the fourth quarter, which was up 2% year-over-year. The company reported direct-to-consumer revenue of $1.4 billion, up 30% year-over-year.
In the fourth quarter, Paramount added 9.9 million subscribers for its Paramount+ streaming platform to hit a total of more than 56 million. The company added 10.8 million total global direct-to-consumer subscribers in the fourth quarter to bring the total to 77 million across several platforms.
“Paramount continues to demonstrate the success of its global multiplatform strategy, with popular content at its core. Nowhere was this more evident than in the growth of Paramount+, which added a record 9.9 million subscribers in the fourth quarter,” Paramount CEO Bob Bakish said.
Paramount also announced it will raise the prices of its streaming service as it rebrands to combine with Showtime in the third quarter of 2023. The new platform will be called Paramount+ with Showtime.
“We all know streaming represents incredible value for consumers and the Paramount Plus offering is far from the industry price leader. We are on the value end of the pricing spectrum,” Bakish said on the company’s earnings call.
The fourth quarter report came on the heels of a 13F filing showing that legendary investor Warren Buffett increased the position of Paramount in Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:","['News', 'Earnings', 'Entertainment', 'Top Stories', 'Trading Ideas', 'General']",0.99981,Neutral,https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/30947498

With a hit show returning for a potential last season, the launch of a new sports rights package, and a series with an impressive all-star cast, AppleTV+ could have a big couple of months ahead.
What Happened: The battle for streaming rights to professional sports leagues could be one of the biggest storylines in the streaming sector. Apple secured the rights to Major League Soccer for 10 years, with the deal set to kick off in late February.
The deal will see AppleTV+ become the home of MLS coverage. Apple paid an estimated $2.5 billion for the sports rights in one of its largest streaming bets since launching AppleTV+.
Along with streaming games, Apple is also launching MLS Season Pass, a new subscription service for soccer fans in over 100 countries and regions. The MLS Season Pass has a cost of $99 per season or $79 per season for existing AppleTV+ subscribers. Monthly subscriptions are also available for $14.99 and $12.99, respectively.
The MLS 2023 regular season begins on Feb. 25 and Apple will be at the forefront of the league, which could make the streaming company a big player in the sports space.

Benzinga spoke with Sidhu to gain insights into his journey and thoughts on the future of AI. Below is a lightly edited version of the conversation that transpired.
Nice to meet you, Bilawal! I hear such great things about you. Care to start with an introduction?
I’m a third culture kid that grew up across India, the U.K. and the U.S.
The computer graphics bug bit me at 11, and it’s been a passion of mine since. This fueled my interest in creative technology and set a foundational theme in my life — the quest to blend the physical and digital worlds. I studied engineering and business at the University of Southern California. From then on, I spent a decade working in augmented and virtual reality, or AR and VR, primarily at Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG)-owned Google.
I’ve had the privilege of building products and experiences with world-class teams that shattered the physical and digital divide. Along the way, I’ve been flexing my creative muscles on social media platforms like YouTube and TikTok, where I have over a million subscribers.
What was it like working as a product manager at Google?
My work at Google has been on 0-to-1 products built on unique datasets. When I started, AR and VR were nascent mediums, and we were laying the foundational building blocks. We created new ways to capture the world, model it with greater realism and understand what’s in it.
Later, we combined those primitives together to help users explore the world around them in an immersive fashion.
Younger generations have spent their formative years in immersive 3D worlds like Roblox Corp (NYSE: RBLX), and their expectations go far beyond the paper maps you and I grew up with.
For instance, if you’re planning your weekend escape, you want to view the best hotels, restaurants and parks. Right now, that’s a painfully chaotic, multi-tab browser endeavor. Today's users want to explore a place remotely and figure out where and when to go.
The immersive view combines Google’s understanding of the real world to let you do that vibe check with just a few taps.
Any experiences that have altered the way you view the world?
My work on 3D mapping in the Geo team takes the cake here. I can no longer walk around a city without seeing a machine-readable 3D model in my head.
We re-mapped the world with satellites, planes and ground-level sensors. We then fused these data sources together to create a ground-up 3D digital twin — perhaps the most ubiquitous model of this pale blue dot we call home. This digital twin connects the world of bits and atoms and powers everything from navigation to flood forecasting, even turning the world into a 3D canvas for AR developers.
Anyone can now build apps that understand where they are, and what they’re looking at and annotate the world around them with remarkable accuracy. This is a fundamental building block for AR experiences anchored in the real world — whether it’s to help you park your scooter or catch a Gorillaz concert in Times Square.
Of course, it’s mobile AR today, but as headsets come online, services like this will be fundamental to the future.

What’s the motivation for staying on platforms like YouTube and TikTok?

One thing was certain, Rahm was a favorite to win the 2023 Masters.
Rahm entered what was expected to be a two-person duel for the Masters championship on Sunday, trailing leader Brooks Koepka. Sportsbooks had Koepka as the favorite entering the fourth round with odds of +100 and Rahm as the underdog at odds of +150.

Warner Bros.' two streaming services, Discovery+ and Max, with the latter also including Discovery+ content, are not properly differentiated, the analyst said.

The market's interpretation of these two data releases has rekindled hopes for a pause in interest rate hikes following the Federal Reserve's May meeting, with rate cut bets rising from the July meeting.
The stock market reacted positively, with major U.S. and global equity markets all in the green, celebrating the growing conviction the rate hike cycle that began in March 2022 is soon coming to an end.

Producer price inflation (PPI) decreased by 0.5% in March, falling short of forecasts for a flat monthly reading, while weekly unemployment claims surged by 11,000 to 239,000, above expectations. The two findings signal that a cooling trend in pricing pressures and the labor market is already underway.
Stocks rallied across the board as investors wagered the Federal Reserve will stop raising in June and deliver the first reduction as early as July, according to latest CME Group FedWatch tool.

Banking giants such as JP Morgan Chase & Co.

Charles Schwab (NYSE: SCHW) reported upbeat quarterly earnings, but sales missed expectations and deposits declined. Alphabet, Inc.

Analysts are wary of the first-quarter earnings season but they expect the market to hold up.
Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, said, “While we don’t think earnings season will bring much in the way of good news, expectations are low enough that we may see stocks hold up again after results just as they generally did during fourth-quarter earnings season in late January through mid-February.”

Here are the key items analysts are watching ahead of the report and what they see ahead for the streaming leader.
Truist Sizes Up Password Sharing: Several research firms have conducted surveys of streaming subscribers to see how important the crackdown on password sharing could be for Netflix's business. 
“We raise our annuals on our password sharing survey and view consensus annual revenue/EBIT/EPS/members as high/reasonable/reasonable/reasonable hurdles,” Truist analyst Matthew Thornton said.
The analyst, who has a Hold rating and price target of $339, is positive on Netflix's growth with the password sharing crackdown and strength of advertising along with other potential catalysts like video games.
Thornton expects first-quarter subscriber additions for Netflix to come in ahead of consensus estimates, with an estimate of 3 million versus a Street estimate of 2 million.
“Download declines quarter-over-quarter were better 1Q23 than 1Q22 and we expect churn quarter-over-quarter to have been better 1Q23 than 1Q22.”
A survey from Truist shows that 33% of those who share passwords would no longer use Netflix and 28% would get their own new account.
“The result is a 4.5% lift to members, 5.7% lift to revenue and 19% or 19.8 million decline in total users.”

St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he still expects hikes and did not rule out pushing the Fed funds rate in the 5.5%-5.75% range. 
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic stated that he expects another rate rise in May, followed by a rate hold in June, stating that inflation remains too high.
Investors now almost fully discount a 25-basis-point hike in May, according to the CME Group Fedwatch tool, and have also priced out a rate cut expected as early as July. 
Major U.S. companies reporting Tuesday, including Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE: LMT), ProLogis, Inc. (NYSE: PLD) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS), reported better-than-expected EPS last quarter, ahead of Netflix's results due after market close.
Cues From Tuesday's Trading: 
Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 were flat on the day, erasing early morning gains after Fed hawkish remarks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 0.1%, while small caps in the Russell 2000 tumbled 0.8%.

The Analyst Takeaways: Thornton called the first quarter results mixed, with several positives and negatives from the company. Among the positives were the average revenue per user for the ad-supported plan coming in higher than expected, and a private marketplace being built for ad inventory.
Negatives for the analyst were guidance below consensus, a lack of ad-supported tiers and the password-sharing crackdown being delayed.
“The company is upgrading its Basic with Ads tier as opposed to launching Standard and Premium equivalent ad tiers,” Thornton said. “Not sure the rationale, though other tiers could/should still come in the future, in our view.”
Helfstein sees a strong future for Netflix given its password-sharing crackdown and the early results in Canada, with comments that revenue was growing faster in the country than in the U.S. The analyst also sees the comments on the ad-supported plan as a positive development.

The Fed could stay on course despite the economic slowdown and raise rates at the upcoming May 2-3 meeting, according to Jeffrey Roach, the chief economist at LPL Financial.
“Businesses appeared to hunker down under the weight of tighter credit conditions and weaker economic growth. If small businesses are an accurate barometer, recession risks are rising and the labor market will likely cool in the coming months,” the analyst said. He does not rule out the possibility of a rate cut by the end of the year if the economy becomes more unstable.

Here are five key takeaways for investors ahead of the report and analyst reactions to past releases. 
What Investors Need To Know
Economists expect retail sales to rebound 0.7% month over month in April, after falling 0.6% in March.

In annual terms, retail sales jumped 2.3% in March — the smallest surge since May 2020. 
Core retail sales (excluding automobiles) will likely increase 0.4% in April, rebounding from a 0.4% drop in March.
Retail sales fell for the second consecutive month in March
Increasing interest rates and cost concerns are weighing on consumers' propensity to spend.
If retail sales fall in April, it would mark the third consecutive month of reductions. The last time three consecutive negative retail sales reports occurred was from August to October in 2015.

Analyst Color: 
A Morgan Stanley analyst called for extended volatility in the market. Morgan Stanley's Lisa Shalett said this week that the market historically continues to fall after the first rate cut, extending the bear market and hitting a new low. The average decline has been 23% after the final rate hike in a monetary policy cycle, she added.
""Investors should take caution and consider portfolio rebalancing and dollar-cost-averaging,"" Shalett said. She suggests looking for income opportunities in both stocks and bonds. Portfolio diversification across asset classes and regions remains key, she added.

Amid unconfirmed reports, let's delve into the most recent news and speculation.
What Happened: Media giant Paramount has been exploring the sale of BET Media Group, which includes the cable networks BET and VH1, as Benzinga reported in March 2023.
Among the interested parties in BET Media Group have been Tyler Perry and Byron Allen.
BET was founded in 1980 by Bob Johnson and has served as a leading media outlet for the Black community, often a place to showcase the talents of underrepresented performers in movies, television and music.
Johnson sold BET to Viacom in 2000 for $2.3 billion.
Perry’s name has generated the most buzz with his success in launching several media brands and being a leading content creator of movies and television shows. In 2019, Perry also contributed to the launch of the BET+ streaming subscription service under Paramount, in which he owns a minority share.
Several media outlets have indicated that a deal between Perry and Paramount has been reached. Hip Hop Vibe reported Perry bought BET Media Group for $400 million.

Nearly all FOMC participants anticipated it would be reasonable to raise interest rates somewhat more by year’s end, Powell said, stressing that the decision to pause hikes doesn’t mean the end of tightening. 
The market slide was spurred by the negative performance from tech titans, with Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) down 4.5%, 2.4% and 2.3%, respectively.
FedEx Corp. (NYSE:FDX) reported slightly better-than-anticipated earnings, but missed revenue estimates and provided disappointing guidance for the upcoming quarters.
Earlier in the day, markets negatively reacted to a hotter-than-expected U.K. inflation rate in May, which fueled expectations for more aggressive Bank of England rate hikes. 
Traders increased their expectations for a 25-basis-point Fed rate hike in July, from 62% last week to 79% today. This shift caused U.S. Treasury yields to move higher during the session. 
Cues From Wednesday’s Trading:
The S&P 500 Index fell 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index lost 170 points or 1.1% for the day. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average held steady, while small caps in the Russell 2000 had a timid 0.1% drop.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated at the ECB Forum on Central Banking that additional interest rate hikes – at least two – are on the way this year, without ruling out hiking at consecutive meetings. Furthermore, the Fed chair said the U.S. economy is highly resilient, and that a recession, while possible, is not the most likely scenario.
The Fed is due to release the results of its annual stress tests for banks at 4:30 p.m. EDT Wednesday.

Analyst Color:
An analyst is optimistic about the near-term market outlook, as he fell back on history to highlight the positivity. When the S&P 500 is up more than 10% for the year-to-date period at the end of June, the performance during the next six months is much better than the average, said Carson Group analyst Ryan Detrick.

The annual rate of inflation has now dropped for 12 months in a row, reaching its lowest point since March 2021.
The reduction in Treasury yields and the sharp decline in the dollar, which is now at its lowest level since April 2022, both contributed to the broad stock market surge.
Traders have trimmed their expectations for Fed rate hikes, and the market anticipates that July will be the final meeting at which the Fed chooses to raise rates. After the inflation data was released, expectations for a rate hike in September dropped from 18% to 12%, and expectations for a boost in November dropped from 33% to 24%.
Cues From Wednesday’s Trading:
Wednesday saw another day of increases for all U.S. stock market indexes, which are on track to post their third straight day of gains.
The S&P 500 Index rose 0.6%, the Nasdaq 100 Index gained 0.7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 150 points or 0.4%. 
Small caps were again the strongest link in the market, with the Russell 2000 index up by 1%.

Despite initial concerns sparked by disappointing growth figures from China, the session saw a rebound for major U.S. indices, signaling renewed investor confidence. Interviewed on Bloomberg TV this morning, Janet Yellen said she does not believe the United States will enter a recession.
The U.S. dollar remained stable throughout the day, with the DXY index trading at its 15-month lows, showing only a slight 0.5% increase since the Federal Reserve began raising rates in March 2022. Meanwhile, U.S. yields remained relatively unchanged, with the 10-year benchmark at 3.8%.
Cues From Monday’s Trading:
The S&P 500 Index gained 0.4%, breaking above 4,500 levels, while the Dow Jones ticked 0.2% higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index rose 0.7% while small caps in the Russell 2000 soared 1.1%.

An increasing share of global fund managers sees it as the most likely outcome over the next 12 months:

Here are some highlights from BofA’s latest Global Fund Manager Survey:


Investors still expect global growth to weaken in the next 12 months.


But only 48% predict a recession by the end of Q1 2024.


In fact, most (68%) see a soft landing as the most likely outcome over the next year.


Sentiment, however, is still stubbornly low.


Investors expect the Fed’s first cut will come in Q2 2024.



June’s retail sales report revealed mixed signals about consumer strength.


Headline sales missed expectations, rising by 0.2% (vs. 0.5% expected) MoM to 1.5% YoY (vs. 1.6% expected).


On the other hand, spending on the core/control group–which excludes food, autos, gas, and building materials and is used to calculate GDP–jumped by 0.6%.


Overall, consumer spending softened but flashed resilience in June amid higher prices and borrowing costs.



Homebuilder confidence rose for the 7th consecutive month in July.


The NAHB Housing Market Index is at its highest since June 2022.


With record-low inventories boosting demand, why wouldn’t it be?


According to Redfin, the total number of homes for sale dropped 15% YoY in June to an all-time low (chart).


At the same time, home prices may have bottomed: June’s median sale price decline was the smallest of the past 5 months (chart) and homes are beginning to sell above their list prices.

The Dow crossed the 35,000 milestone, on track for its fourth straight session of gains. 
Strong earnings remain the driving force behind the stock market, while investors eagerly await quarterly results from Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) and United Airlines Holdings Inc. (NYSE:UAL), all of which are scheduled to report after the closing bell.
The market is now entering a light week in terms of macroeconomic releases, with only the S&P Global Flash PMI on Monday being in the spotlight before the pivotal event of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting on Wednesday, July 26.
A lower-than-expected U.K. inflation rate, combined with increased speculation that the ECB may stop raising interest rates after July, created pressures in both the euro and the pound, fueling a rebound in the U.S. dollar index.
Cues From Wednesday’s Trading:
After officially entering a bull market on Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average continued to outperform other U.S. major averages on Wednesday, rising 0.4% for the day.
The S&P 500 Index gained 0.3%, while the Nasdaq 100 inched 0.1% higher. Small caps in the Russell 2000 edged 0.2% higher.

The company ended the quarter with 238.39 million global paid subscribers, up 8% year-over-year.

The end of Fed hikes may be on the horizon but what about their effects on the economy?


According to TD, the peak impact from a rate hike occurs ~4 quarters later for GDP and ~6 quarters later for inflation.


In other words, what we see now is the effect of policy rates from mid-2022.


That means the peak impact of rate hikes on the economy has yet to be felt.


As Apollo’s Torsen Sløk notes, this will likely lead to further deterioration in credit conditions and lending growth.



Corporate bond spreads act as a proxy for overall macro concern among bond investors.


What are they saying?


Excluding a spike in March following the banking crisis, spreads have declined since October.


In fact, spreads are just as low now as they were before the banking failures.


This suggests investors believe the impact of macro headwinds on future earnings will be minimal.



Housing starts in the US fell by more than expected in June.


Building permits also declined against estimates for a modest gain.


Permits for single-family homes (SFH), however, increased by 2.2% and have been steadily rising which points to a rebound in SFH starts ahead (chart).


On the other hand, permits for multi-family units fell to the lowest since October 2020.

The Netflix Analysts: Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne has an Equal-weight rating and price target of $450.
Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris has a Buy rating and $500 price target.
Baird analyst Vikram Kesavabhotla has a Neutral rating and $340 price target.
Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein has an Outperform rating and raised the price target from $500 to $515.
Needham analyst Laura Martin has a Hold rating and no price target.
KeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson has a Sector Weight rating and no price target.
William Blair analyst Ralph Schackart has an Outperform rating and no price target.
Morgan Stanley On Netflix: Netflix reported better-than-expected second-quarter subscriber additions, and its paid sharing progress was strong, Swinburne said in a note. 
“By 4Q, we expect it to deliver on its goal to reaccelerate revenue growth to double digits,” the analyst said.
The analyst calls the crackdown on password sharing a success; the strategy was viewed by some as risky due to the potential of increased churn.
“Not only is the risk now behind Netflix, but the incremental 4 million net adds upside in 2Q shows they are converting those highly engaged ‘borrowers’ to new members.”

The tech-heavy index is on track to suffer its worst trading session in more than a month.
On the other hand, a solid earnings beat by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) lifted the blue-chip Dow Jones Index up 0.9%, putting it on course for its ninth consecutive session of gains, the longest winning run since September 2017.
On the macro front, jobless claims came in below expectations last week, signaling a still-resilient job market. Speculators upped their bets for another rate hike after July, hedging from some unexpectedly hawkish remarks as the Federal Reserve meets next week. Both the dollar and short-term Treasury yields rallied. 
Cues From Thursday's Trading:
The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 was the weakest link on Thursday, down 1.5%. The S&P 500 contained losses, down 0.3%, while small caps in the Russell 2000 Index slipped 1%. 
The Dow was the outlier, up 0.8%, as health care, consumer staples and utilities outperformed other sectors.

During the previous month, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) surged by 3.4% compared to the previous year, surpassing the forecasted 3.2% increase. Core inflation stood at 3.9% annually, exceeding the expected 3.8%, primarily driven by the persistent high costs of shelter.
Latest Fed remarks had a chilling effect on the markets. Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin indicated his willingness to consider rate reductions once inflation is on track to reach 2%, while Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester expressed the view that March might be too early for a rate cut.
In response, traders adjusted their expectations for interest rates, with the implied probability of a March rate cut falling from 70% to around 63%, while maintaining their overall bet of six rate cuts throughout 2024.
Meanwhile, Treasury yields remained relatively stable, while the U.S. dollar strengthened by 0.2%.

Traders will receive data on the central bank’s preferred inflation gauge, specifically the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Index, on Friday. This number could be crucial as it is expected to shape investor expectations regarding the upcoming rate decision on Jan. 31.
Cues From Last Week's Trading:
Stocks closed the holiday-shortened week ending Jan. 19 on a positive note. Traders overcame early-week jitters caused by some Federal Reserve officials and economic data that dampened hopes of rate cuts. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited’s (NYSE:TSM) strong outlook attracted buyers back into the market on Thursday. This positive sentiment drove the S&P 500 Index to a record high in Friday’s session.
LPL Financial Chief Global Strategist Quincy Krosby noted, “As technology, semiconductors, and consumer discretionary led the S&P 500 to new highs, it reflected the strength of the growth sectors that underpinned the inherent strength in the bull market that was born earlier last year.”

Earnings releases from 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) and General Electric Co. (NYSE:GE) led to a pullback in their stocks during premarket trading. Meanwhile, shares of consumer and personal products company Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) rose in response to its earnings.
The focus now shifts to after-hours trading when streaming giant Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and semiconductor company Texas Instruments, Inc. (NASDAQ:TXN) are set to report. On the economic front, Tuesday represents a lull before a slew of key data, including the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge, begins to roll in.
Cues From Monday's Trading:
U.S. stocks closed higher for a third consecutive session on Monday, with small-caps leading the charge. Although the major averages opened higher, the strength of the rally waned after a report revealed that the Conference Board’s leading economic index fell once again in December. Despite this, the indices showcased resilience, remaining above the unchanged line throughout the session, albeit closing off the highs.
The S&P 500 and the 30-stock Dow Industrial average concluded at fresh all-time highs, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite reached a two-year high. Notably, the Nasdaq 100 Index, consisting of the largest non-financial tech stocks, also achieved record territory.
Among S&P 500 sector indices, buying interest, albeit subdued, was nearly broad-based, with only consumer and utility stocks losing ground.

Wednesday’s announcement of a stimulatory measure by the Chinese central bank has the potential to extend the strength of U.S.-listed Chinese stocks.
Cues From Tuesday’s Trading: 
Major indices closed with mixed results. The Dow faced early pressure from negative earnings reports by 3M Co. (NYSE:MMM) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), leading to a lower start. Conversely, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indices opened positively. The Dow, however, hit the day’s low in early afternoon trading before partially recovering losses. It concluded the session lower, breaking a three-session winning streak. In contrast, the Nasdaq and S&P 500, after dipping below the unchanged line, rebounded in the afternoon, closing modestly higher.
Communication services and consumer staple stocks emerged as notable gainers during the session.

Earnings news remains mixed, potentially resulting in offsetting impacts. The focus shifts to preliminary fourth-quarter GDP data before the market opens and the European Central Bank’s rate decision, with traders anticipating the central bank to maintain its current stance.
Cues From Wednesday's Trading:
U.S. stocks closed with a mixed performance on Wednesday, as the Dow Industrials moved further away from its all-time highs, while the S&P 500 marked its fourth consecutive all-time closing high. The varied sentiment unfolded as traders absorbed a positive quarterly report from Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and better-than-expected private sector activity data. The subdued sentiment might be attributed to concerns ahead of key economic data scheduled for release on Thursday and Friday.
Strength in the communication services sector, led by Netflix, along with gains in energy stocks, helped offset weakness in utility, real estate, material, consumer staples, and financial stocks.

Later iterations were MAGA, which included Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) along with Apple, Alphabet and Amazon, and MAMAA, comprising Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon.
The phrase Magnificent Seven was first used by BofA Securities analyst Michael Hartnett in 2023. The constituent companies spearheaded the stock market rebound during the year, thanks to the dominant market positioning, innovativeness, brand appeal and financial muscle of these companies.
