And that’s not even counting the potential for policy headlines from Washington, which played a big role in trading last week.
This morning, trading seems pretty subdued ahead of the big week. That’s probably to be expected as Wall Street tends to look to earnings for a snapshot of the recent past and guidance for future performance. About a third of S&P 500 Index (SPX) companies are set to open their books this week.
Investors probably want to hear more about Biden’s potential capital gains tax hike on high earners, news of which contributed to last week’s price volatility.
There’s good news on the vaccine front as the Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) jab is back in distribution in many U.S. states after health officials lifted an 11-day pause on use of the vaccine amid worries about blood clotting as a rare side effect. 
With so much to consider this week, you might want to keep an eye on Wall Street’s main measure of investor jitters, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX). The index is up this morning, but it’s hanging out at just under 18. A number below 20 in this market appears to mean alarm bells aren’t really much of an issue. But there could be plenty of room for surprises this week amid so many earnings reports, a Fed meeting, and lots of economic reports.
The Week Ahead In Economic Data
This morning, we saw durable goods orders for March come in softer than expected—up 0.5% against a Briefing.com consensus forecast of a 2.0% gain. The numbers come after durable goods orders in February unexpectedly fell after a string of gains. A month ago, some economy-watchers suggested the soft February number could have been an anomaly—a nonlinear data point within an uptrend. This month’s tepid number might call into question the pace of the current recovery. Still, it was a positive number, and considering how atypical this pandemic period has been, the recovery is likely to be atypical as well.  
Tomorrow, the market is scheduled to get two February price indices for the housing market and a consumer confidence number for April from the Conference Board. Last time around, the index for March showed consumer confidence at its highest point in a year amid recovery expectations. With the vaccine rollout progressing well, in the United States at least, it could be interesting to see whether the numbers show another jump.

Monday's Spotlight
After the bell, the California-based EV pioneer and clean energy company Tesla is expected to report its first-quarter earnings of $0.79 per share. Elon Musk is also expected to give special attention to its Autopilot, its suite of advanced driver-assistance systems, which has been again criticized for lulling some drivers into a false sense of security and implying self-driving abilities well beyond its existing capabilities.

Despite all the fireworks, it turns out that Azure wouldn’t be MSFT’s biggest story in the quarter to follow.
The big story is arguably more complex. It’s not just MSFT’s huge $20 billion acquisition of artificial intelligence (AI) software company Nuance Communications (NASDAQ: NUAN), but the larger subplot of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) that potentially hints at an outline of MSFT’s longer-term strategy. 
M&A will likely be on peoples’ minds when the company reports fiscal Q3 earnings Tuesday, but so will the usual suspects like cloud, Office, and LinkedIn. Last time MSFT reported, fiscal Q2 Azure revenue grew 50% and total commercial cloud revenue rose 34%, setting high bars for MSFT as it prepares to report its latest financial results.
Buy Or Build? Expanding Horizons And Market Share
MSFT’s acquisition of NUAN adds another point to the buying-spree narrative that appears to be unfolding. 
Last month, MSFT bought video game holding company ZeniMax Media for $7.6 billion. Last year, the software giant was on track toward buying TikTok for $30 billion before the deal got derailed. 2016 marked the company’s largest acquisition—LinkedIn—for $26 billion. And chat app Discord just turned down MSFT’s $10 billion acquisition offer.
Each company MSFT targets represents entry into a potentially new market—or a larger footprint into an area in which the company had previously been in a more “exploratory” stage. The NUAN acquisition is kind of unique because it may give MSFT a subtle but solid foothold in the healthcare sector while boosting its capacity in AI ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['News', 'M&A', 'Earnings', 'Guidance', 'Health Care', 'Options', 'Markets', 'Tech', 'General']",0.99994,Neutral,https://amp.benzinga.com/amp/content/20793834

Again. 
It’s only been six weeks since the last Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, but they’re gathering again today. The usual press conference featuring Fed Chairman Jerome Powell comes right after the meeting ends at 2 p.m. ET tomorrow, and analysts don’t expect any change in policy. 
Trading might be a little slow ahead of all this, which is kind of typical when investors await the latest from Powell and company. Major indices didn’t move much in the overnight session. That being said, the Fed may be about the third-most important event this week after gross domestic product (GDP) and Tech earnings. 
Looking ahead to this afternoon, Tech takes center stage with earnings from Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). More on all that farther down. 
This earnings season is now about one-third finished, and 84% of companies have beaten Wall Street’s consensus earnings estimates, according to FactSet. That’s well above the average level of positive surprises, which indicates analysts may have been too conservative heading in. General Electric (NYSE: GE) did very well but the stock’s down a bit, and Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) also reports later on, which could be interesting. 
Fed Ahead As Investors Await Views On Latest Strong Data
Unlike last month, we don’t get a “dot-plot” of Fed officials’ outlooks for rates this time around. For that, we have to wait until the mid-June FOMC meeting. But Powell might be asked to comment on recent booming economic data and higher than expected inflation readings. 
The Fed puts return to a healthy jobs picture high on its list, and the last two initial jobless claims reports and March payrolls both suggested progress. It could be interesting to get Powell’s thoughts on these numbers and what they might mean going forward. 
That said, it would be very surprising to hear Powell say anything about getting more hawkish anytime soon. The Fed’s feet seem firmly planted in the dovish camp, and Fed funds futures suggest no change in rate policy this year. It’s likely Powell wants to see a few more solid jobs reports—including May payrolls—before making any new pronouncements about the employment picture. 
It’s kind of unfortunate timing that the Fed meeting concludes Wednesday—a day before Powell and the rest of us get a first look at the government’s estimate for Q1 gross domestic product (GDP) growth (see more below). Thursday also brings the weekly initial jobless claims data. 
After two solid weeks in a row, it would be good to see more improvement. However, anything under 600,000 would extend the streak of reports below that level. It’s still high, but a major improvement after months of 700,000 to 800,000 new claims a week. Before Covid, the average was well below 300,000, but it’s unclear when we’ll get back to those kinds of levels.

Aside from the Fed, earnings continue hot and heavy this week, highlighted by a couple of key semiconductor companies (see below).

Shipping those goods, though, can be problematic with tariffs and duties, various tax rates and currency conversion issues.

Shopify's Oberlo brand estimates that 2.14 billion people will shop online in 2021 and Statista said that the average order value for an international sale is $147, a 17% premium over the average domestic sale for a U.S.-based seller. It also found that retailers offering international shipping grow 60% faster than those that don't.

The statistics for selling globally are compelling, but the challenges are daunting.

Global e-commerce shipping and logistics company FlavorCloud was founded on the premise of helping local sellers achieve global success. The 3-year-old company on Tuesday announced a $6.3 million Series A investment round led by Mucker Capital. Mucker partner Omar Hamoui will join the FlavorCloud board.

Additional funding from the deal came from Rise of the Rest and Willow Group. Rise of the Rest is also an investor in FreightWaves, Modern Shipper's parent company.

""We live in a global marketplace. However, it is consistently hard for DTC e-commerce brands to offer their products to an international audience,"" said FlavorCloud founder and CEO Rathna Sharad. ""FlavorCloud makes it simple to ship to anyone anywhere in the world, with a seamless consumer experience, which has an incredible impact on enabling these DTC brands to expand globally. We've created a platform that is truly a game-changer."" 

The DTC e-commerce marketplace is estimated to be $4.5 trillion, but many businesses are unable to tap that global market due to the complexities of moving goods across borders – especially smaller parcels that may represent one-off sales.

""FlavorCloud has tapped into an underserved and massive cross-border enablement market, one that has grown explosively over the past year as the pandemic has accelerated nearly every aspect of e-commerce.

""As customers look for more convenience in their daily lives, we're excited to deliver another service that not only helps them save time but provides peace of mind knowing that tonight's dinner is safe in their garage and out of the weather.""

Key In-Garage Grocery Delivery is available where Amazon offers grocery delivery at no additional cost to Prime members, the company said.

Amazon added that customers can view deliveries through a Ring smart home camera and a Ring Protect Plan or with a LiftMaster Smart Garage Camera powered by myQ with a myQ video storage subscription.

That’s in part due to the continued increase in online shopping, strong tailwinds from last year that are anticipated to endure, and because the company helpfully provides guidance for revenue and operating income. Of course, guidance isn’t a guarantee, but the insight can be helpful.
Having said all that, there are plenty of unknowns in the long term. One worrisome thing is how both the public and politicians in the U.S. and overseas are starting to become more verbal about just how, well, “Amazonian” the company has become, raising antitrust and other concerns.
We’ll take a deeper dive into the regulatory picture a bit lower down. For now, let’s look at what kind of quarter investors might expect from this $1.7 trillion company when it reports, an event expected after the close this Thursday.
Another Quarter Of Revenue Increases
Covid provided a big boost to AMZN’s revenue in 2021 as online shopping grew and businesses relied more on the cloud, and that’s expected to remain a supportive factor in the company’s Q1.
As a reminder, in the last three quarters of 2020, AMZN’s earnings exceeded analysts’ expectations by a whopping 606% (Q2), 67% (Q3), and 95% (Q4). In Q4 it delivered its largest quarter by revenue of all time, generating $125.56 billion in sales. Though Q1 didn’t have a holiday season or Amazon Prime Day, we were still in a pandemic with people continuing to show a preference for online shopping.

Unlike last May, there’s arguably lots to look forward to as vaccinations gain steam. People are back at baseball stadiums, and the Kentucky Derby and Memorial Day picnics loom. Oh yeah, we’ve also got the April jobs report straight ahead.
OK, so maybe jobs data aren’t as exciting as a famous race or a full picnic basket after a year without many fun events. Having said that, the April non-farm payrolls data scheduled for Friday, May 7, could help set the tone in a big way for stocks and bonds this coming month, which makes it more than just another hum-drum economic report.
Payrolls, along with the aftermath of April’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, could affect trading in the days and weeks ahead, giving a sense of whether jobs strength continued from March and if it’s strong enough to get investors worrying more about potential economic overheating.
There’s a lot to May beyond the jobs report and anything Fed governors may say in their upcoming presentations, but it’s hard to argue those aren’t two key factors. Other things to watch include continued Q1 earnings, progress fighting the pandemic both in the U.S. and overseas, any developments with the Biden infrastructure plan, and any news in what’s been an active M&A scene.

FIGURE 1: TECH OUTPACED. This year-to-date chart of the S&P 500 Index (SPX—  candlestick) vs. the Nasdaq-100 (NDX—purple line) shows the broader market generally out-pacing the Tech-heavy NDX so far in 2021. Does this pattern continue in May, or can Tech find new traction? Data Sources: Nasdaq, S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.
From Famine To Feast With Employment Data
Last May started off with whatever the opposite of a “bang” might be. The April payrolls report released then showed more than 20 million Americans losing their jobs and the unemployment rate skyrocketing to 14.7%. We were all basically at the mercy of an unseen enemy.
Fast-forward to this March. Job growth hit 916,000 and the unemployment rate fell to 6%. That rate is still way above pre-pandemic unemployment, and you can’t forget that millions remain jobless. Even considering all that, it was a really good sign of improvement that could set the stage to see if positive growth continued into April.
Early signals look solid. We’ve just seen two of the lowest initial weekly jobless claims data since before Covid, at under 600,000. That’s still a lot, but remember it was over a million for a while last year. It’s early to make predictions on April payrolls, but these newer numbers continue to see the trend move in the right direction and that’s what you want.
The question is whether another huge payrolls number—which isn’t assured, in part because some March gains might have reflected hiring delays from weather-related ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['News', 'M&A', 'Earnings', 'Commodities', 'Treasuries', 'Federal Reserve', 'Pre-Market Outlook', 'Markets', 'General']",0.86662,Neutral,https://amp.benzinga.com/amp/content/20838606

Leadership in the S&P 500 flip-flopped once COVID vaccines were announced last November and the months-long rotation into value and cyclical companies kicked off.
Since early March, these recovery stocks have petered out, replaced by a sort of musical chairs of equity front-runners, from classic big tech companies to utilities and staples stocks. The power of the core cyclical trade fizzled in tandem with the climb in Treasury bond yields, which have been under pressure since the month began. But now, they’re waking up again. Bond bulls and bears have been fighting in the tape the past week, and it seems bears are getting stronger the past few sessions as economic data is just too hot to ignore.

Well, these days everyone probably would complain about inflation if it ever reappeared in a major way, but the Fed promises it won’t do anything about it until employment is on track toward whatever “normal” was before the pandemic. 
As Wall Street analysts expected, the Fed didn’t change rates or make any other policy changes coming out of this week’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting that ended this afternoon. Rates stayed near zero, where they’ve been for over a year, and the Fed remains committed to its $120 billion a month bond-buying program designed to keep borrowing costs low and refuel the economy coming out of the pandemic. 
At first blush, this looks like a pretty dovish meeting, and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell made clear the Fed isn’t talking about any decline in asset purchases or increase in rates. There were three things investors were curious about going in—asset purchases, rates, and inflation—and Powell was dovish on all of them. 
Treasury yields actually began to fall as the Powell press conference went on this afternoon, with the 10-year yield edging down toward 1.61% to 1.62%. That’s down a few basis points from this morning’s two-week highs. 
There was no change to the Fed’s commitment, outlined last month, to basically stand on the sidelines “for some time” if year-over-year inflation stays “moderately” above what has been the Fed’s long-term goal of 2%. Core inflation, per the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) prices report, was 1.4% in February, the most recent month tracked. However, consumer prices are already rising more than 2% on a year-over-year basis. 
Optimism Club: Fed Sees Positive Signs For Economy
There were a couple of changes in the Fed’s statement from last time, with the Fed now saying employment has “strengthened.” Arguably, you could see that as an improvement from “turned up” in its March statement. The statement noted some inflation, but again said it’s likely to be “transitory.” March consumer prices rose 2.6%, the highest year-over-increase since August 2018. 
In another change, the Fed’s statement now says sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak, but have “shown improvement.” The public health crisis still weighs on the economy, the Fed said, but no longer on employment or inflation. 
Still, inflation doesn’t seem to be a really big concern now for the Fed, judging from how the statement and press conference went. They seem basically comfortable with inflation staying above 2% for the rest of the year because that will be against very easy comparisons to a year ago, when we had the big slowdown due to Covid. The Fed apparently believes we’ll have to wait until next year to get a reliable sense of what inflation is doing 
The stock market had been mixed earlier Wednesday and stayed that way after the Fed’s decision and as investors waited for Powell to start his press conference. The S&P 500 Index (SPX) actually made up some ground and turned green after the statement. Earnings continue to be solid but the SPX hadn’t really gone anywhere since earnings season started, possibly an indication that a lot of the strength in earnings was already built in. 
Basically, this meeting looks like a placeholder. That means attention could focus more on the big earnings reports from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) coming up later today, along with the gross domestic product (GDP) report and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) earnings due tomorrow. 
One thing Powell isn’t ready to do is chip around the edges of the Fed’s program to support the economy.

China’s services sector slowed this month, data showed, and manufacturing remains barely in expansionary mode. We still have weakness out of Europe, and China was expected to be coming along. Now that there’s a little weakening in China, that’s something rattling the markets a little bit. Another thing troubling some investors is the fact that more fiscal stimulus is coming in when many economists aren’t really sure it’s needed, which drives concerns about inflation. 
Speaking of which, core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) prices came in at 0.4% for March, a little higher than analysts had expected and higher than the previous reading of 0.1%. Markets are worried that we really haven’t gotten to the full impact of recovery and how that surge in demand is going to affect prices. There’s still lots of recovery to go and PCE prices are already up 2.3% year over year. The market’s a little concerned because companies are reporting supply shortages as it is and we aren’t even in full reopening status. 
April On Pace For Firm Wall Street Gain As Earnings Roll On
There’s still a lot of earnings ahead, and next week brings the April payrolls report. But for headline excitement, no week in the quarter can match the one we just had. Four of the five “FAANG” companies reported, the Fed held its meeting, and investors got a first look at Q1 gross domestic product.
The S&P 500 Index (SPX) set a new record high yesterday, but it looks like some profit-taking might be in the mix this morning. That’s not too surprising considering this is the last day of the month and the SPX is up 6% so far in April. 
After stumbling in January, the SPX is on pace for its third straight month of gains, up about 12.1% year-to-date. More than 80% of S&P 500 companies reporting so far have beaten Wall Street’s consensus earnings estimates, and generally they’ve painted optimistic pictures about the coming months as the economy reopens. That said, the market hasn’t really found a lot of traction since earnings season began, hinting that it could be at levels where buyers are becoming a bit scarce.
Energy comes into focus today with earnings from a couple big players, Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX). They report as the price of gasoline approaches $3 a gallon across the U.S., up more than $1 from a year ago. Investors may want to hear from executives about media reports of possible gasoline shortages in parts of the country due in part to logjams in the supply chain. One challenge that recently cropped up is finding qualified fuel truck drivers to transport the product to gas stations. 
Crude slipped again this morning, falling back toward $63 a barrel on apparent demand worries. There does seem to be major resistance near $65. The front-month futures contract knocked against that again yesterday and ran into sellers.
The same thing might be happening in the bond market, where 10-year yields can’t make much progress above 1.65%. A move above that earlier this week didn’t find much traction, and we’re back near 1.64% this morning. Any rally back toward 1.7% or above could grab traders’ attention after the dovish Fed meeting ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['News', 'Earnings', 'Commodities', 'Options', 'Markets', 'Tech', 'General']",0.99421,Negative,https://amp.benzinga.com/amp/content/20890262

That’s because, historically, the strongest period for the market tends to be the stretch between November-April, with May-October lagging, according to The Stock Trader’s Almanac. 
Whether May will be a selling month remains to be seen, but there seems to be a sense that history might repeat given how elevated many stocks are. The Nasdaq Composite (COMP) and S&P 500 Index (SPX) both gained more than 5% in April, with the latter closing at a record high on Thursday before succumbing to some profit-taking on the last trading day of the week.
Selling pressure doesn’t seem to be a feature of this morning’s trading, with the path of least resistance appearing to be to the upside. Investors seem optimistic given the backdrop of a stronger-than-expected earnings season, improving economic data, a strong vaccine rollout in the United States, government stimulus, and easy monetary policy from the Fed.
Earnings Season Going Better Than Expected
With earnings season in full swing, investors have plenty to digest as they try to form a picture of the market in the near term based on corporate performance, executive commentary, and company outlooks. 
Investors can learn a lot from executives during corporate earnings calls discussing the reopening economy and emerging consumer trends they’re seeing.
So far most of the SPX companies that have reported have beaten earnings expectations. On Friday, FactSet said that more SPX companies are beating earnings estimates for the first quarter than average, and that those beats are coming with a wider-than-average margin. 
Of the 60% of SPX companies reporting first-quarter earnings, 86% of them had reported earnings that exceeded estimates, above the five-year average of 74%, FactSet said Friday. (See more on earnings below.)

No longer is going to a physical store and browsing the aisles the only method of shopping. More browsing than ever is taking place online, more sales than ever are occurring in digital spaces and more pressure on retailers is driving change – and new challenges – that continue to alter the shopping experience.

Understanding these changes are key to creating successful customer journeys. More importantly, though, is understanding what the modern consumer seeks. A series of recent reports provide some insights into the consumer of 2021 and what they say is important to them, giving retailers and brands a road map to fulfilling consumer needs.

The Face Of The Online Consumer

In Jungle Scout's Q1 2021 Consumer Trends Report, consumers reported that free shipping was the top reason to shop online. That jumped up from the fourth spot in the Q4 report, suggesting shipping cost was less of a factor during the busy holiday season. Lower prices, which was sixth in the Q4 report, jumped up to No. 2 in Q1. Convenience was third in Q1 after topping the survey in Q4.

The report, which surveyed 1,005 U.S. consumers Jan. 26-29, 2021, found that 46% of consumers leave items in their online cart and forget about them, suggesting brands have some work to do to convert these customers.

When it comes to which online retailers are most popular, it's no surprise that Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) topped the list, with 73% of respondents saying they shopped at Amazon.com at least once in the past three months. Amazon was followed by Walmart (NYSE: WMT) at 40%; eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) and Target (NYSE: TGT), 18% each; and Kohl's (NYSE: KSS) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), 10% each.

When it comes to returns, 31% of respondents said they would return a product bought from an online store. That number increased slightly, to 32% for Amazon shoppers, but both numbers remained below the 37% who said they were likely to return an item at a physical store.

Consumers looking for items often start with Amazon, with 74% of them saying that is their first online stop. Search engines were popular as well, with 65% saying that's where they start researching items. A brand or retailer's website was cited by 38% followed by social networks Facebook, 31%; YouTube, 29%; Instagram, 21%; and TikTok, 10%. (Note: Respondents could select multiple answers.)

When it comes to getting a product in a timely manner, though, the clear choice is Amazon, with 64% saying they turn to Jeff Bezo's platform.

Nearly three-quarters of consumers – 73% – believe the majority of shopping will happen online in the future and 43% said they would be fine if they never shopped in a physical store again. A full 58% of consumers shop online at least once a week if not more.

When it comes to price and shipping considerations, 68% of all consumers said they are looking online for the item with the lowest price, but 48% said they would pay more for that item if ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['News', 'Earnings', 'Commodities', 'Global', 'Markets', 'Tech', 'Media', 'General']",0.73566,Positive,https://amp.benzinga.com/amp/content/20912096

The Borderplex Alliance is an El Paso-based economic development nonprofit. In the past nine months, Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), T.J. Maxx Inc. (NYSE: TJX) and Critical Materials Corp. have announced plans for major distribution centers in the far West Texas city.

El Paso cross-border trade struggled during the pandemic, dropping to $29.2 billion during 2020, compared to $76.6 billion in 2019, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.

The El Paso port of entry also handled only 286,434 commercial trucks in 2020, compared to 792,441 in 2019.

Barela said in the wake of the pandemic he sees more nearshoring opportunities for the Borderplex, a transborder region that includes the cities of El Paso and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, as well as Las Cruces and Santa Teresa, New Mexico.

This interview was edited for clarity and length.

FREIGHTWAVES: Do you often hear from foreign companies wanting to relocate to the Borderplex?

BARELA: ""We're at a record level of being vetted; people have discovered our region as being a compelling choice for a business expansion and relocation. We are coming off a record year in 2020 in terms of expanding our economic base and job creation [more than 2,000]. We're expecting that trajectory to continue again throughout this year and into the next as we recover from this COVID pandemic.""

FREIGHTWAVES: Can you expand on how much nearshoring the region could see in the future?

BARELA: ""Our trading relationship between Canada, Mexico and the U.S. remains extremely strong. Those clearly are our primary trading partners in our region. But we are experiencing an increased level of reshoring opportunities in our region from China and other parts of Asia. I think that is going to continue for the next year or two; reshoring momentum that has started will not abate in any way. In the short term, or maybe the medium term due to the heightened tensions we have with China, both militarily and through trade, I don't see the Biden administration changing any major policies right now, in terms of their approach in dealing with China.""

Tech stocks rose in pre-market trading, but can they maintain those early gains? That’s one question hanging over Wall Street today. 
We’ll talk more about the trauma in Tech lower down. First, let’s take care of some data and earnings business. 
There’s more good news on the jobs front today as initial weekly jobless claims fell to 498,000, well below the 527,000 Wall Street had expected. It’s the fourth week in a row below 600,000 and the first reading below 500,000 since before the pandemic. Having the number come in below 500,000 is going to set up some high expectations for tomorrow’s nonfarm payrolls report. 
On the earnings side of things, Uber (NYSE: UBER) shares didn’t receive the same kind of love in overnight trading as competitor Lyft (NASDAQ: LYFT) did the night before. Instead, UBER turned lower after the company reported a narrower than expected quarterly loss following the close yesterday. A miss on the revenue line and hints of rising expenses might help explain why investors were less enthusiastic. Most companies missing on revenue have gotten taken out to the woodshed this earnings season.
That’s what’s happening to Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA) in pre-market trading, too. Its shares are down 5% following a miss on revenue and a beat on earnings per share for the Covid vaccine company. MRNA, along with BioNTech (NASDAQ: BNTX)—another Covid vaccine maker—might be getting hurt more by the growing momentum among global policymakers to waive patent protection for Covid vaccine makers. President Biden yesterday added his name to the list of those supporting the idea. 
Another company we’ve heard a lot about over the last year, Peloton (NASDAQ: PTON), is scheduled to report after the close one day after shares tanked following its treadmill recall. Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) and Square (NYSE: SQ) are other earnings reports to consider watching today, with ROKU another good chance to check how streaming demand is looking. “Gross payment volume,” or GPV, is a key metric to watch when you check SQ’s earnings. 
Stocks have really entered a holding pattern here. If you check the close of the S&P 500 Index (SPX) yesterday vs. its close on April 15, it’s a three-point difference. A holding pattern would probably sound good right now to anyone with lots of Tech stocks in their portfolio. The Nasdaq 100 (NDX) is down nearly 4% since April 15. 
Technically, however, both the SPX and the Nasdaq (COMP) have remained above their 50-day moving averages. Any test of those levels could be interesting to watch for signs of either buying the dip or a new wave of selling. The 50-day MA for the SPX is 4019, and for COMP is 13,513. 
Hurry Up And Wait For Jobs Report
Yesterday and today appear to be mostly about range-bound trading ahead of tomorrow’s April payrolls report. As a reminder, consensus on Wall Street is for a gain of one million jobs and a decline in the unemployment rate to 5.8%. 
The same numbers were 916,000 and 6% in March, so we’re talking incremental improvements. Even if the data meet expectations, the economy will remain way behind where it was pre-Covid on the jobs front, so it’s important not to let a few good numbers cause anyone to forget that. 
As always, it’s also important to check the mix when you look at job numbers. In March, most of the growth was concentrated in lower-paying services jobs as reopening gained steam.  Overall wages actually fell. There’s nothing wrong with leisure and hospitality jobs like bar-tending or waiting tables, but it would be better for the economy to see ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['News', 'Earnings', 'Guidance', 'Markets', 'Tech', 'General']",1.0,Negative,https://amp.benzinga.com/amp/content/20991352

The nonfarm payrolls report this morning showed the economy added just 266,000 jobs, far less than expected. And the unemployment rate rose to 6.1% from 6% last time around. A Briefing.com consensus had expected 1 million jobs to be added and an unemployment rate of 5.8%. Meanwhile, the prior report’s estimate that 916,000 jobs were added in March was revised down to 770,000.
Most of the gains came from leisure and hospitality, which are basically old jobs coming back. But manufacturing jobs edged lower, and construction employment was flat—not particularly good signs for the economy. One thing to keep in mind though is that states are reopening at different rates, and it may take some time for those new jobs to hit the books, meaning that it may not be until next month’s jobs report that we see some more of the added jobs we were expecting this time around.
Hourly earnings did form a bright spot, rising by 21 cents compared to a 4 cent decline the last time around. The rising hourly earnings mean some of the jobs created may have been higher paying. Having said that, the overall takeaway (and maybe the silver lining) is that the soft jobs growth data may ease concerns about inflation (see more below).
As you take today to digest the data, it might be helpful to remember some of what’s been leading up to the jobs report.
The labor market has been improving, but new jobless claims still remain elevated by historical standards even though they’re now comfortably below their peak from the financial crisis. The vaccine rollout in the United States has been going well, but there are still global hotspots where coronavirus case counts have been rising. And investors seem to be generally optimistic about the economic recovery but have been wary of rising inflation.
That mixed sentiment seems to have kept investors from going whole hog into reopening stocks. While they keep one foot in stay-at-home names, they’ve also pulled back on mega-cap growth stocks amid yield spikes in longer-term U.S. government debt that come along with inflation expectations.
And with those expectations comes a double-edged sword of the economic recovery—worry that the Federal Reserve will begin tightening monetary policy by tapering its asset-buying program or by raising interest rates, or both.  
But this morning the economic recovery prospects didn’t seem as bright as they once did, tamping down talk about a recovery that causes the economy to overheat. 
In fact, the yield on the 10-year Treasury initially fell to two-month lows around 1.47% on the news as problematic inflation seems farther ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['News', 'Earnings', 'Guidance', 'Treasuries', 'Economics', 'Markets', 'General']",1.0,Negative,https://amp.benzinga.com/amp/content/21012978

We’re having an initial reaction now where everything sells off and rates are pushing higher, but we’ve already seen hints of this coming from earnings. Based on what executives said, it would be hard to believe if there wasn’t some inflation pressure developing and showing up in today’s number.
This is one report, so it’s nothing to lose our minds over, but it backs up what we’ve been hearing. To recap, the consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.8% last month, compared with Wall Street’s consensus for 0.2%. The CPI is up 4.2% year-over-year. These are big numbers, but remember that last year set a low bar considering the struggles with Covid at the time. 
The S&P 500 Index (SPX) was already lower in pre-market trading before the data hit, and immediately dived when CPI came out. The 10-year Treasury yield also ticked up a couple basis points to just under 1.65%. It was below 1.5% at one point last week, so this is a pretty big move. Volatility also edged up after the news. Higher rates might have a chance of helping the Financial sector today if they can hold the line against what looks like a lot of pressure coming from the rest of the market. 
Rising inflation numbers over time might get the Fed worried, but Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has made it clear over and over that we should expect inflation and that it will be temporary. With the easy comparisons to a year ago continuing over the next few months, it might not be until Q4 when we get a true picture of the price situation. 
CME Fed funds futures now show a 9% chance of a rate hike by the end of the year, up from 7% earlier this week. Historically, readings like those don’t show much worry about increasing rates. However, if inflation continues to ramp up, it might put more focus on when the Fed might start “tapering” some of its bond-buying.
The intense inflation focus heads into day two tomorrow when the government releases the April producer price index (PPI). Circling back, the March report might have given many investors an unpleasant shock, rising a full 1% month over month. Analysts had expected decent gains, but not that dramatic.
For tomorrow’s April PPI, the Wall Street consensus, according to Briefing.com, is 0.3% for the headline PPI and 0.4% for core, which excludes food and energy. Those aren’t low numbers, but remember the comparison is against the big gain in March. For more on what to watch beyond the headlines in PPI, see below. 
Stepping away from prices, the Tech slide that briefly halted late yesterday appears ready to resume this morning following weakness overnight in the FAANG stocks. Semiconductor shares also came under pressure in overnight trading. On the charts, Tech is beginning to show some technical weakness, which may weigh on these stocks as the day continues. 
Having said that, yesterday’s rally in the Nasdaq (COMP) was nothing short of incredible. Some of the recovery may have reflected “buy the dip” mentality (see more below). It’s going to be worth checking to see if that happens again on today’s early weakness.
Asian and European markets were mixed overnight, while crude resumed its climb and is now above $66 a barrel. 
Inflation? Taxes? A Combination? Struggles Continue
If it seems like the market just can’t get going lately, that’s because it can’t. In general, there’s this thought that inflation may rear its ugly head. We see a little bit higher rates, not significantly, but a bit. And this struggle between value and growth continues at the same time.

Takeaways From 13F Season: Investors who follow particular fund managers can easily look up what each was buying and selling in the quarter, but other investors may be more interested in overall themes from 13F filings. The first quarter of 2021 was a big quarter for the S&P 500, and investors were likely interested in what top managers were buying and selling to kick off 2021.

Google parent Alphabet has the attention of fund managers, with Tepper selling and Soros and Klarman buying.
ViacomCBS had a volatile quarter in part due to the unwinding of Archegos Capital, and fund managers took notice. Tepper and Soros were buying, while Klarman was selling.
Buffett continued selling financial stocks and drug stocks and reversed course by selling Chevron just one quarter after taking a stake in the oil giant.
Several fund managers traded ETFs to play particular themes. Despite inflation fears, Einhorn sold the GLD gold fund while Soros reduced his exposure to emerging markets by selling the EEM fund.

Here’s a rundown of how the smart money was playing some of the most popular stocks last quarter.

Despite not showing substantial signs of weakness, a number of institutions purchased a considerable number of puts, betting over $2.99 million the QQQ Trust Series is either headed lower or they're unsure and wanted to hedge bullish positions. This could be due to the following two possibilities:

Technology sector weakness: Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) are the top three holdings in the QQQ Trust Series 1, making up 10.94%, 9.70% and 8.38% of its total, respectively.

(NASDAQ: PLUG) are two energy stocks that have excited and disappointed investors in equal measure in recent times.
An analyst at BTIG, however, is unequivocally bullish on the two equities. 
The EV Stock Analyst:  Analyst Gregory Lewis initiated coverage of both  Nikola  and Plug Power with Buy ratings.
The analyst has an $18 price target for Nikola shares and a $40 price target for Plug Power shares.
The Nikola Takeaways:  Nikola is looking to disrupt the heavy-duty Class 8 truck market with the Nikola Tre battery-electric truck, with the first deliveries targeted by year-end, Lewis said in a note.
The Nikola Two hydrogen fuel cell vehicle is scheduled for a mid-2023 launch, the analyst said. 
The Tre BET will target the urban truck market given its limited range, he said.
The two models of the hydrogen fuelcell electric vehicle, namely Tre and Two, have the ability to disrupt the long-haul truck market, translating to long-term success for the company, Lewis said.

(NASDAQ: AMZN) came out in support of the federal legalization of marijuana, announcing it will drop marijuana testing requirements for some of its workers.
Dave Clark, CEO of Amazon’s worldwide consumer division, said in a blog post that the e-commerce giant will actively support the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act of 2021 (MORE Act), which would decriminalize marijuana at the federal level. The bill was reintroduced in Congress last Friday.
Canopy Growth Corporation (TSX: WEED) (NASDAQ: CGC) reported its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 earnings with a net loss for the year amounting to CA$1.7 billion ($1.41 billion), representing a CA$283 million wider loss versus FY 2020. 
The Canadian cannabis giant attributed these results to various expenses, credit losses, lower income tax recoveries, advancements of gross margins and sales reductions.
Cantor Fitzgerald’s analyst Pablo Zuanic kept a ‘Neutral’ rating on Canopy’s stock, lowering their price target to CA$30.50 from C$32.
Canopy’s quarterly business-to-business sales were stable, and therefore better than its competition and previously provided outlook, explained Zuanic in a Tuesday note.
According to the analyst, good business-to-business sales in the quarter should reveal significantly advanced March shipments, with many other cannabis companies reporting double-digit drops in adult-use shipments for the same period. “So, in that context, these are good numbers.”
Later in the week, Canopy dropped its deal with Canadian rapper Drake. Their partnership was structured around an agreement where Drake would hold a 60% stake in a cannabis brand named More Life Growth Company, while Canopy would control the remaining 40%.
Commenting on the news, Green Market Report’s Debra Borchardt told Benzinga, “Canopy Growth continues to log massive net losses which tend to overshadow the company's revenues. Despite reporting over half a billion in revenues this week, the company's continuing efforts to rightsize and clean up old deals have left a mark. Dropping Drake from the lineup this week wasn't too shocking, but it would be great if Canopy could have a week where it wasn't forced to deliver another negative news headline.""
Benzinga Cannabis’ content is now available in Spanish on El Planteo. 
Meanwhile, on Thursday and Friday, Benzinga hosted a new edition of the Benzinga Cannabis Capital Conference, featuring most of the top names in the industry. Speakers discussed a wide array of topics, from building a $1 billion cannabis supplies company and the road to federal legalization to the CBD beverage market, growing cannabis in hotter climates and multi-billion dollar M&A deals.
And Hempz, a hemp seed oil-based skin and body care brand, named HBO's Pretty Little Liars star Ashley Benson as its new celebrity ambassador.
EFTs were all down. Over the four trading days of this week:

The ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (NYSE: MJ): lost 3%.
The AdvisorShares Pure Cannabis ETF (NYSE: YOLO): tumbled 1.1%.
The AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF (NYSE: MSOS): dropped 2.2%.
The Cannabis ETF (NYSE: THCX): was down 2.7%.
The Amplify Seymour Cannabis ETF (NYSE: CNBS): lost 1.6%.
The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) closed the week almost flat at $422.60.

While more and more states vote or legislatively choose to legalize medical or adult-use cannabis, there is growing emphasis to include equity measures to help correct years of racial disparities and outright injustices caused by the failed war on drugs.
The state of Rhode Island seems to be taking the lead in this.
The Most Progressive Measure 
A coalition of anti-racist cannabis activists and labor organizers is pushing for one of the most progressive cannabis legalization measures in the U.S., writes The Intercept.
At the moment, New York has the most social justice-focused pot policy, with 40% of the state's cannabis tax revenue earmarked for investment in Black and Latinx communities most affected by the drug war and half of New York's cannabis licenses will go to social equity applicants.

What Happened: G7 members Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States pledged to enforce a minimum global corporate tax rate of at least 15%.
In addition, they committed to ensuring taxes are paid in the countries in which revenues are generated, potentially eliminating the transfer of profits to tax shelters like Ireland.

The past week's bullish calls included the e-commerce leader, a top biotech and the airlines.
The iPhone maker, the top cryptocurrency and a COVID-19 vaccine maker were among the bearish calls seen.

The big three U.S. indexes offered mixed signals last week, with the Nasdaq ending almost 2% higher, the S&P 500 up fractionally and the Dow Jones industrials lagging with almost a 1% retreat.
The S&P 500 did manage to eke out a new record high last week, but overall, Wall Street seemed to be in wait and see mode, with speculation that the reopening cycle may have already peaked, former drivers tech and financials still sputtering and ahead of the coming week's FOMC meeting. The Consumer Price Index came in hotter than expected, though the muted market reaction suggests inflation fears may have already been priced in.
Bucking the low volume trend last week were the meme stocks, which offered retail investors another wild ride. In addition, a notable FDA drug approval gave biotech stocks a bit of a boost. Still, some investment firms are anticipating a muted second half of the year for the markets.

Tweed’s philosophy appears to have survived well into the 21st century, at least according to Jan Eeckhout, author of the new book “The Profit Paradox: How Thriving Firms Threaten the Future of Work.”
In his book, Eeckhout details how a relatively small number of companies have created an off-kilter environment over the past four decades in which they have consolidated economic controls to a point where they can exist without fear of either competition or government regulation. As a result of this situation, workforce wages have mostly stagnated and prices on consumer and industrial goods are in constant ascension.
Eeckhout, who is the ICREA Research Professor at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona and previously taught at the University of Pennsylvania, University College London, Princeton University and New York University, spoke with Benzinga about “The Profit Paradox” and the state of global macroeconomy.
Benzinga: How did you come about with the thesis for your work?
JE: The thesis is based on facts, and we see two things. First of all, with the new fast technological change that's going on, we see that those highly productive firms — these very big innovators — have become very profitable, which is a good thing because innovation is a good thing. That's the driver of the economy, that's how we get progress and growth.
At the same time, this past ecological change has also led to a lopsidedness within the industries, because an Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) or a Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) is so productive and is so much better than anyone else that they actually grab the entire market.
Still, couldn’t an argument be made that these companies are giving the public what it wants?
JE: I'm the first one who loves Amazon, because I get a lot of stuff at a low price and it's very convenient. But the reason why they can do it is because our central tenets of competition don't work.

The S&P 500 Index, considered a measure of broader market performance, ended the year down 19.44%, reversing much of the 27% advance in 2021.

The show passed “Dahmer” to be the second most-viewed English language series over the course of 28 days, trailing only the fourth season of “Stranger Things.”

With Amazon shares struggling, could Bezos make a triumphant return in 2023?
What Happened: Ritholtz Wealth Management Managing Partner Michael Batnick included Bezos returning as the CEO of Amazon as one of his 10 stock predictions for 2023.
“Amazon experienced its largest share price decline on an annual basis since the dot-com bubble burst,” Batnick said. “Jeff Bezos spent 27 years at Amazon and has been gone for less than two. In 2023, he pulls a Bob Iger and returns to steady the ship.”
Batnick shares the stock performance of Amazon since 1999, which is as follows:
1999: +42%
2000: -80%
2001: -30%
2002: +75%
2003: +179%
2004: -16%
2005: +6%
2006: -16%
2007: +135%
2008: -45%
2009: +162%
2010: +34%
2011: -4%
2012: +45%
2013: +59%
2014: -22%
2015: +118%
2016: +11%
2017: +56%
2018: +28%
2019: +23%
2020: +76%
2021: +2%
2022: -50%
Shares had their worst return since 2000 in the past year. Batnick pointed out 2022 was much different than 2000 and the dot-com bubble.

Microsoft’s stock, however, took a turn for the worst Wednesday as UBS analyst Karl Keirstead downgraded the company from Buy to Neutral and lowered the price target from $300 to $250, citing a softening outlook for Microsoft Azure and Office.

The state of the job market is closely tied to Fed’s decisions on raising interest rates: the strongest available policy for the agency to steer the course of the economy, impacting consumer demand, inflation, lending and other major issues.
While official figures for the job market will be out tomorrow, a preliminary report released Thursday revealed a glimpse into what to expect.
ADP Research, in collaboration with Stanford Digital Economy Lab, announced on Thursday morning the U.S. economy, led by consumer-facing service industries, added 235,000 jobs in December 2022. 
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 263,000 in November, keeping steady from September and October numbers.

While video game adaptations have had a mixed track record at the box office, many of the recent ones have performed well as television series.
What Happened: HBO and HBO Max will premiere “The Last of Us,” a television adaptation of a bestselling video game, on Jan. 15, 2023. The debut comes shortly after HBO and HBO Max took home four wins and had 14 nominations, the most among streaming-related companies at the 2022 Golden Globes.
“The Last of Us” is based on the bestselling and award-winning video game from Naughty Dog, a unit of Sony Group Corp (NYSE: SONY). The game was released in 2013 and exclusive to consoles from Sony. A sequel released in 2020 was also among the bestselling video game titles in recent history and was widely praised.
Adapting a video game franchise into a movie or television series can be a difficult task and comes with risks and rewards with a built-in fan base that can love the idea and want to watch, or quickly turn and be upset that the content doesn’t follow the game.
The series stars Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie and centers on the two characters in a post-apocalyptic world.

A new report pointed to an NFT initiative from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) coming this spring.
Here are the details and what it could mean.
What Happened: A new report pointed to Amazon exploring interest in digital assets and NFTs. The news came after it was recently announced Amazon’s cloud segment Amazon Web Services was partnering with Avalanche (CRYPTO: AVAX), a layer-1 blockchain.
A report from Blockworks said Amazon was exploring interest in layer-1 blockchains, blockchain-based gaming companies and digital asset exchanges. The sources told Blockworks NFTs could be a big part of the new initiative that could launch in the spring of 2023.
One example in the report saw Amazon offering games to customers that would offer free claimable NFTs.
A source told Blockworks that Amazon was entering the crypto and NFT space was big “for many different reasons.”
“We knew it was possible, but now it seems like it’s really happening. That’s going to affect the existing players in the space — if they execute and do this right and are smart about it,” the source said.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) is releasing its fourth-quarter financial report after the close Thursday. Here’s what investors need to know ahead of the print. 
The consensus estimate for Amazon’s fourth-quarter revenue is $145 billion, in line with the e-commerce giant’s recent guidance. Amazon said during its third-quarter call in October that it expected fourth-quarter revenue to be between $140 billion and $148 billion, equating to year-over-year growth of between 2% to 8%.
The company made headlines on Tuesday for illegally resisting unionization efforts by its employees, as per a National Labor Relations Board judge.
Markets have been responding positively in anticipation of the call, with the company's stock gaining almost 20% in the last month and 4.6% in the last five days.
Hard Times Ahead For Big Tech?
On Monday, Barclays analyst Ross Sandler cut the price target for Amazon from $140 to $130 and maintained an Overweight rating.

Brady previously announced his retirement from the league in February 2022 before deciding one month later that he would return.
Brady said in his retirement video on social media on Wednesday that this time he is stepping away from playing ""for good."" 
Brady was the oldest player in the NFL for the 2022-2023 season. Drafted 199th overall in the 2000 NFL Draft on April 6, 2000, a lot has changed since Brady first entered the league.
Here’s a look at 23 things that weren’t around when Brady joined the NFL.
Cryptocurrency: Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) was founded in 2009, following a white paper released the previous year. The market capitalization of Bitcoin is more than $400 billion and one of many cryptocurrencies that are now readily available to trade by consumers, including on the FTX app endorsed by Brady.
Twitter: Social media platform Twitter Inc was founded in March 2006. Brady has 2.8 million followers on the social media platform as of today.
Facebook: Social media platform Facebook, which is owned by Meta Platforms inc (NASDAQ: META), was founded in 2004, two years after Brady joined the NFL.
Instagram: Photo and video sharing social media platform Instagram, which is owned by Meta Platforms, launched in 2010. Brady has more than 13 million followers on Instagram, but trails his ex-wife, model Gisele Bundchen at 20.5 million.
iPhone: Now one of the most popular smartphones in the world, the iPhone wasn’t launched until 2007 by Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL). Brady couldn’t own an iPhone until his eighth season in the NFL.
Netflix Streaming: Now used by hundreds of millions of people worldwide, the ability to stream movies and television shows from Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) wasn’t a reality when Brady joined the league. Netflix launched in 1998 as a DVD by mail service and would later add streaming in 2007.

The major averages opened modestly lower and moved sideways until the Fed rate announcement. With the Fed serving a 25 basis point hike, in line with expectations, but hinting at more rate hikes to come, stocks initially reacted negatively and slipped further immediately after the verdict was announced. Following Chair Jerome Powell’s  presser, stocks launched into a rally in late afternoon trading.
The Nasdaq Composite Index rose to its highest level since Sept. 12 and the S&P 500 Index settled at its highest level since Aug. 25.
Technology, communication services and consumer discretionary stocks spearheaded Wednesday’s rally, while the energy sector served as a drag.

The ETFs are launched in partnership with Unusual Whales, which has been covering the unusual stock trading activity of members of Congress for years. Here are the details.
What Happened: In 2022, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) had its worst-performing year since 2008. That didn’t stop 20% of the members of Congress who traded stocks and options from beating the market, a number that is higher than that of professional money managers over time.
Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has seen increased scrutiny over the trades made by her husband Paul Pelosi, who is a venture capitalist. Many of the trades disclosed by Pelosi have shown questionable timing ahead of new policy changes and bills from Congress. Pelosi has said publicly that she does not share any information with her husband.
The increased calls to ban members of Congress from trading stocks while in office led to Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) recently introducing the PELOSI Act, officially called Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments Act.

MAUs of 450 million came in slightly below the analyst and Street estimates.

What Happened: Bezos has a current wealth of $126 billion, ranking third in the world.
The wealth was driven by an increase in the valuation of Amazon over the years, the company Bezos led for 27 years before stepping down as CEO in July 2021.
One of the reasons Amazon might be so successful could have been Bezos’ leadership and business practices.
A company such as Amazon likely held many meetings between executives, employees and potential partners.

The game will also showcase Super Bowl commercials and movie trailers that could be heavily discussed during the game and in the days after. Here’s a look at the movie trailers you will likely see.
What Happened: A 30-second advertising spot for Super Bowl LVII will cost around $7 million, which could create a nice windfall for Fox Corp (NASDAQ: FOX), the company airing Super Bowl LVII.
Media companies often used the widely watched sports contest as a way to get their upcoming movie blockbusters in front of a wide audience with movie trailers released for the first time during the game.
The movies expected to have trailers in the game and their studios are listed below; information from Deadline:

“Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quanntumania”: Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS)
“Fast X”: Universal Pictures, a division of Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA)
“Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3”: Disney
“The Flash”: Warner Bros. Discovery Inc (NASDAQ: WBD)
“The Little Mermaid”: Disney
“Elemental”: Disney
“Scream VI”: Paramount Global (NASDAQ: PARA)(NASDAQ: PARAA)

Companies are looking for an edge with the release or original shows and movies, live sports and other exclusives.
Here’s a look at the latest from Paramount Global (NASDAQ: PARA) (NASDAQ: PARAA) and how it stacks up to rivals.
What Happened: Paramount Global reported revenue of $8.13 billion in the fourth quarter, which was up 2% year-over-year. The company reported direct-to-consumer revenue of $1.4 billion, up 30% year-over-year.
In the fourth quarter, Paramount added 9.9 million subscribers for its Paramount+ streaming platform to hit a total of more than 56 million. The company added 10.8 million total global direct-to-consumer subscribers in the fourth quarter to bring the total to 77 million across several platforms.
“Paramount continues to demonstrate the success of its global multiplatform strategy, with popular content at its core. Nowhere was this more evident than in the growth of Paramount+, which added a record 9.9 million subscribers in the fourth quarter,” Paramount CEO Bob Bakish said.
Paramount also announced it will raise the prices of its streaming service as it rebrands to combine with Showtime in the third quarter of 2023. The new platform will be called Paramount+ with Showtime.
“We all know streaming represents incredible value for consumers and the Paramount Plus offering is far from the industry price leader. We are on the value end of the pricing spectrum,” Bakish said on the company’s earnings call.
The fourth quarter report came on the heels of a 13F filing showing that legendary investor Warren Buffett increased the position of Paramount in Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:","['News', 'Earnings', 'Entertainment', 'Top Stories', 'Trading Ideas', 'General']",0.99981,Neutral,https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/30947498

Opportunities Ahead But Be Astute
Please click here for a chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

Plenty of opportunities are ahead in 2024, but you need to be astute as to when to buy, what to buy, and how to buy if you want market beating returns.  
The chart shows that during the Santa Claus rally, the stock market did not hit the top band of the resistance zone. In the very short term, this is a negative.
The chart shows the stock market has pulled back to the low band of the resistance zone. To maintain bullish posture, the stock market needs to not go much below the bottom band of the resistance zone.
There are likely many stops right below the bottom band of the resistance zone.  If the stock market starts dropping, hunt and destroy algorithms will go into action and take out the stops. This is the reason that The Arora Report recommends not placing stops at obvious points.
Historically, after the stops are taken out, there is a bounce. Officially, the period for the Santa Claus rally will end at the close tomorrow.
RSI shown on the chart is on a sell signal, but the pattern is such that it can quickly reverse to a buy signal.
RSI on the chart shows negative divergence. In plain English, this means that RSI and the price are moving differently. This is a negative in the very short term.
In the early trade this morning, there is considerable tax related selling. Historically, such selling is common after a strong year. The reason is that investors did not want to sell in 2023 to avoid paying capital gains taxes for the 2023 tax year.  By selling now, they have successfully postponed paying capital gains tax by one year.
As the year starts, investors are again making the classic mistake that we warned you about late last year. The classic mistake investors make at this time of the year is to act on the following:

2024 year end targets from Wall Street strategists
Sector recommendations from Wall Street strategists


In our 40 years in the markets, a vast majority of the time, Wall Street strategists are wrong. To understand the recent history, consider the following:

Right now, investors are worshiping permabulls and deriding permabears.
In 2023 at the start of the new year, investors were worshiping permabears and deriding permabulls. What did the stock market do? The stock market went up.
In 2022 at the start of the new year, investors were worshiping permabulls and deriding permabears. What did the stock market do? The stock market went down.

What Happened: Cramer on Tuesday predicted that investors might move away from the leading Magnificent Seven tech stocks to invest in sectors that have experienced significant declines, like the food and pharmaceutical industries, reported CNBC.
Cramer stated, “My crystal ball suggests that profits will be taken from the best of the best, including the Magnificent Seven and friends, as well as the richly valued software enterprise names. I think investors will use that cash to invest in companies that haven’t gotten any respect for ages.”

Cramer warned that this shift might be temporary, with investors potentially returning to their December favorites once earnings reports are released.

New Economic Data
Please click here for a chart of Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ: QQQ).
Note the following:

The chart shows tech stocks have fallen back into the support zone.
RSI on the chart shows tech stocks are near oversold.
The stock market has a consensus now that everything is going to be immaculate – the landing, the Fed, interest rates, earnings, adoption of AI, Russia, China, and the Middle East.
The stock market is assuming a 90% probability of seven rate cuts.
The stock market is going to face new economic data today:

ISM Manufacturing Index will be released at 10am ET. The consensus is 47.1%.
JOLTS report will be released at 10am ET.


The stock market will also face minutes from the last FOMC meeting at 2pm ET. Powell was dovish in the press conference, flipping 180 degrees. At The Arora Report, we will be reading the Fed minutes to see if the 180 degree flip was unanimous or if there was dissension.
If the new data and the Fed minutes are supportive of immaculate everything, expect a rip roaring rally and new highs.
If the data is not supportive of immaculate everything, expect momo gurus to come up with a new narrative to try to run up the stock market.
Market mechanics are neutral as of this writing in the premarket but can easily swing in either direction after the data and Fed minutes.
Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin has made two key points this morning:

Rate hikes are not off the table.
The soft landing is at risk.


As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in the protection band, which strikes the optimum balance between various crosscurrents. Please scroll down to see the protection band.

He expects Amazon's 2024 ad growth to be aided by new initiatives, including more ads in Prime Video and the ramp of new ad partnerships. 
Ad revenue strength can potentially contribute to his margin upside thesis on the stock, as his analysis suggests advertising revenue will contribute 370 bps to FY23 North America (NA) margins. 
BofA maintained a Buy rating on Amazon with a price target of $168.
In addition to retail efficiencies, the analyst sees potential for ad revenue upside to drive margin upside in 2024.

However, Marc Chaikin, founder and CEO of Chaikin Analytics, believes that this does not signify an end to the rally that began in late October.
During his appearance on Benzinga PreMarket Prep, Chaikin highlighted his perspective, especially for the 493 stocks in the S&P 500 that fall outside the realm of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech giants. He pointed out that this period could be particularly significant for these stocks, suggesting potential opportunities outside the tech sector.
Despite a small gain during Thursday morning, the broad market index remains 1.1% lower since 2024 trading began on Tuesday. The exchange traded fund that tracks the index, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) is down by the same amount.
Chaikin puts this in context by explaining that on Tuesday, when the S&P 500 fell by 1%, there were more stocks that gained than stocks that lost. Because of the huge weighting of the Mag7 — Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Nvidia Inc (NASDAQ:NVDA) et al — the market was lower.

Which stocks and sectors are likely to welcome these cuts the most?
The December inflation report will be published on Thursday and it is among the key economic data reports that shape Fed policy in the early months of 2024. Consensus estimates suggest the annual headline rate will tick higher to 3.2%, up from 3.1% in November.
Equity markets, as a whole, responded last year to signs inflation was cooling and the Fed wouldn’t raise interest rates beyond the 5.25%-5.5% hit in July. Between late October and the end of December, the S&P 500 put on 16% — as did the exchange-traded fund that tracks it, the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY).

“The countdown to the latest U.S. inflation reading has begun, and investors are hunkering down ahead of a potentially volatile period for markets,” said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG.
He added: “Broader risk-off sentiment could prevail tomorrow and beyond should U.S. inflation show signs of reviving.”

The 60-year-old billionaire is also the founder, executive chairman, and former CEO of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), the fifth-largest company worldwide with a market capitalization of $1.6 trillion. 
Bezos founded Amazon in 1994, initially as an online bookstore operating out of his garage in Seattle. However, after recognizing the potential of e-commerce, he later expanded the company’s offerings beyond books, entering into diverse product categories including movies, music, electronics, computer software and other consumer goods. 
The early years were marked by challenges, including skepticism from some investors, who reportedly favored brick-and-mortar book-selling giant Barnes & Noble at the time. Undeterred, Bezos persisted and continued to introduce innovations like Amazon Prime, Kindle, and the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing platform.

The AWS launch brought the company close to bankruptcy, leading to a 14% workforce reduction. However, the next year saw a remarkable rebound, with a $400 million profit announced. Today, AWS dominates the global cloud services market with a reported 32% share.

What Happened: Hanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University, suggests that the stock market is overvalued and will likely see a decline as the anticipated recession begins to impact,  reported Business Insider on Thursday.
“As far as the outlook for stocks goes, they remain pricey, and the multiples will come off as the recession starts to bite,” said Hanke.
The S&P 500 index, after a 24% surge in 2023, is currently trading near an all-time high. Hanke, however, cautions that stocks, usually valued at multiples to company earnings, are expected to drop during a recession due to decreasing multiples and reducing earnings.
Hanke, who served as an economic advisor to Ronald Reagan and was the president of Toronto Trust Argentina in 1995, attributes the recent unstable inflation to alterations in the U.S. money supply rather than supply-chain disruptions or variations in energy and metal prices.

Encouragement is also drawn from Congress’s agreement on a bill to fund the federal government until early March. Additionally, the day’s trading direction may be influenced by a few Federal Reserve official speeches, a consumer sentiment reading, and regional bank earnings.
As sentiment takes a positive turn, the focus shifts to the S&P 500 Index, with anticipation of surpassing its previous all-time high of 4,796.56 set in early January 2022.
Cues From Thursday's Trading:

Tech optimism fueled a market rebound on Thursday following positive fourth-quarter earnings from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM). Further strength was added by Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic’s comments hinting at a potential rate cut in the third quarter.
The major averages opened higher but followed divergent paths, with the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 maintaining gains throughout the session. The Dow Industrials initially stayed mostly in the red before moving into positive territory late in the afternoon, breaking a three-session losing streak.
The Nasdaq 100 Index, consisting of the 100 largest non-financial tech stocks, closed Thursday’s session at a new record.
Economic readings revealed a surprise drop in jobless claims for the week ended Jan. 13, a larger-than-expected contraction in Philadelphia region manufacturing activity, and a mixed housing starts report.
S&P 500 rally leaders included IT, communication services, industrial, and IT services stocks, while defensive utility and real estate stocks ended the session lower.

The firm’s deputy CIO, Dan Suzuki, believes that the current market signals could lead to a significant shift in investment dynamics.
What Happened: Richard Bernstein Advisors (RBA) has been signaling a potential investment opportunity amidst concerning signs in the stock market, reported Business Insider. The firm has been predicting a “once-in-a-generation” opportunity for months, and it appears to be on the verge of realization.
According to RBA’s Deputy CIO Dan Suzuki, the market’s current situation, particularly the dominance of a few stocks, could lead to a broader market shift. The firm’s thesis, proposed at the end of last year, suggests that the extraordinary market leadership of a small group of stocks will expand to the wider market, resulting in stronger gains for the other 493 S&P 500 stocks.
However, Suzuki warned that the corporate earnings of major tech companies are expected to decelerate in the next quarter.

What Happened: Launched with seed funding of $6.5 million, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust became the first U.S. ETF on Jan. 22, 1993.

The success of the SPY ETF led to other financial institutions launching similar ETFs that track the S&P 500 Index, one of the largest and most well-known stock market indexes.

One notable case involved Christy Browne, a retired teacher from New York, who was tricked into buying $2,000 in Walmart gift cards in February 2020.
She was led to believe she was aiding an FBI investigation into money laundering. The outlet reported that these cards were, in fact, funneled into a complex laundering scheme orchestrated by Qinbin Chen, a Chinese national based in Virginia.
Chen's operation, responsible for laundering approximately $7 million in fraudulently obtained gift cards, spanned across the U.S. and China, victimizing hundreds.

What Happened: Amundi, with $2 trillion under management, anticipates a less robust economic growth in the upcoming year, which could result in a weaker performance from the leading mega-cap stocks, reported Business Insider on Saturday.
In a panel discussion at the New York Stock Exchange, Craig Sterling, the head of equity research at Amundi U.S., stated that the firm is underweight on U.S. stocks for 2024. He highlighted the significant difference between the current stock market and that of a year ago.
Despite the S&P 500’s impressive 25% surge in 2023, the “Magnificent Seven” stocks, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), were the primary drivers of this growth.

This week, Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are all set to report their quarterly results, and analysts anticipate that AI-focused companies will outperform expectations, potentially sustaining the equity market rally.
Despite this optimism, investors may exercise caution leading up to a two-day Federal Reserve meeting beginning on Tuesday. While economists expect the Fed to maintain the current high rate, traders will be attentive to signals regarding the trajectory of interest rates. Meanwhile, the Chinese market continues to experience volatility, driven by concerns about its troubled property sector.
Cues From Last Week’s Trading:
In the week ending on Jan. 26, major stock indices saw gains for a third consecutive week, buoyed by optimism surrounding the economy, inflation, and earnings. Key drivers included preliminary fourth-quarter GDP data highlighting the economy’s strength, varied earnings reports, and the December personal consumption expenditure index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure.
The S&P 500 Index reached record levels for four sessions during the week, concluding just below the record, while the Dow Industrials closed the week in record territory.

Equity and M&A experts believe that, after a year beset by volatile markets and rising interest rates, 2024 offers improving conditions for takeover deals and corporate mergers.
“Capital markets were not as open or freewheeling, and 2023 did not happen the way we thought it would,"" said Tom Miles, Head of Americas M&A at Morgan Stanley. 
“The market forces are in place that make an eventual return inevitable. It's not a question of if but when.”
One piece of the M&A jigsaw that was largely missing last year was private equity (PE) firms. These players use leveraged buyout methods to take poorly performing publicly traded companies private. The goal is to exit via an IPO or sell off the assets at a profit.
Pitchbook analyst Tim Clarke noted how higher interest rates made it more costly for PE firms to engage in deals.
“PE's share of M&A has no doubt been constrained by reduced access to leverage,” he said. During 2023, PE involvement was the lowest total recorded going back to 2005.
Overall volumes of M&A dropped to $2.4 trillion in 2023, down from $3.1 trillion in 2022 and $5.2 trillion at its 2021 peak.
But analysts at Morgan Stanley expect both corporate and PE deal-making to be stronger in 2024 after the fourth-quarter rally on equity markets in 2023.
“Corporate balance sheets are strong, financing markets are improving and CEO confidence, which is closely correlated with M&A activity, is climbing,” said Miles.
Which sectors, then, can investors expect to lead this increase in M&A activity. There’s agreement here on three sectors that appear ripe for takeovers to ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['News', 'M&A', 'Analyst Color', 'Equities', 'Large Cap', 'Broad U.S. Equity ETFs', 'Small Cap', 'Economics', 'Small Business', 'Markets', 'Analyst Ratings', 'Tech', 'ETFs', 'General']",0.99086,Positive,https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/36824293

Ahead of these earnings announcements, RBC Capital Markets analysts have highlighted Amazon and Meta as their preferred choices. They are focusing on whether artificial intelligence can keep sparking interest without boosting revenue, how China’s economic slowdown affects the market, and the extent of growth in the Cloud sector.
Delving into the insights of RBC Capital’s analysts, spearheaded by Brad Erickson, he said, “Given how the market has rebounded over the last few months, risk/rewards are more balanced, in our view, but with such strong fundamentals likely on the way, we stay the course on Amazon and Meta.”

What Happened: Wolfenbarger, a seasoned market observer, anticipates a severe drop in the U.S. stock market and a prolonged recession. Wolfenbarger, with over three decades of investing experience, relies on a variety of economic indicators that suggest an impending downturn, according to a Business Insider report Tuesday.
Wolfenbarger, the founder of Bull and Bear Profits and a former JPMorgan banker, is particularly concerned about the consistent decline of The Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index and the longest stretch of an inverted yield curve in more than half a century. His forecast is more severe than The Conference Board’s, which predicts a two-quarter recession.
“The depth of the latest yield curve inversion has only been matched or exceeded by those preceding the Great Depression and the major recessions of the mid-1970s and early 1980s,” said Wolfenbarger.

The team’s recent findings indicate a concerning concentration of market power in the hands of the top 10 stocks on the MSCI USA Index, reminiscent of the worrisome market conditions seen two decades ago.
As Bloomberg reported Tuesday, the combined share of the MSCI USA Index’s top 10 stocks, including the prominent ‘Magnificent Seven’ technology giants, has escalated to a significant 29.3% in December. This figure approaches the historical peak of 33.2% witnessed in June 2000, during the height of the dot-com bubble.
Diversity within these top ranks is also dwindling, with only four sectors represented, a stark contrast to the historical median of six. This lack of diversification heightens the vulnerability of the market to shocks in these sectors.

What Happened: Business Insider reported that the newly launched YieldMax Magnificent 7 Fund of Option Income ETFs will invest in seven established YieldMax single-stock ETFs. Announced on Tuesday, these funds use covered-call options strategies to generate capital gains and income from leading technology giants, including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).
The fund will be reallocated monthly to ensure an equal weighting of each of the seven YieldMax ETFs within the Fund’s holdings. The move would give accessibility and streamline ownership for shareholders, with indirect exposure to the Magnificent Seven through a single ETF.

Given the Federal Reserve’s data-dependent stance, a couple of manufacturing activity data and the routine jobless claims data due for the day could draw traders’ attention.
Cues From Wednesday's Trading:
U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday, stung by the double-whammy of earnings disappointments and a hawkish Fed. Traders reacted negatively to earnings from Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), all of which have significant weightings in the S&P 500 Index.
The major indices started the session lower and moved roughly sideways until the Fed decision. The Dow was seen moving in and out of the unchanged line as it received support from a strong upward move in Boeing Co.’s (NYSE:BA) shares. The Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 indices languished in negative territory.
Following the rate decision, the indices either moved above the flat line or trimmed their losses. Jerome Powell disappointed traders by offering no clear signal toward a rate-cut schedule, so they dumped stocks in late afternoon trading.
The S&P 500 Index pulled further away from its record close, with the broader gauge and the Nasdaq Composite settling at the lowest levels in about two weeks. 
The market witnessed a broad-based sell-off, with communications stocks being the worst hit. IT, consumer discretionary, and energy stocks also saw marked weakness.

Stock Market Direction
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows the stock market has pulled back on Powell’s remarks.
The chart shows the stock market is near the top band of the support zone.
The chart shows that in the early trade, the dip in the stock market is being bought.
The FOMC rate decision came as expected yesterday. However, Powell trampled on the speculation of a rate cut in March. Please read yesterday’s Afternoon Capsule for details.
Fed Chair Powell said labor availability is a big factor in the Fed’s decision.
Previously, the Fed was trying to drive unemployment higher. The reason was in traditional economics, higher unemployment brings down inflation.
This cycle has defied traditional economics thus far. Inflation is coming down while unemployment remains very low.
In The Arora Report analysis of Powell’s press conference, the Fed is not worried about inflation running back up. However, the Fed is concerned about inflation being sticky and staying above their target. If the employment picture stays strong, it will be difficult for the Fed to cut interest rates as the Fed does not want inflation to get stuck above their target. This is the reason prudent investors are paying very close attention to the jobs report.
The jobs report, known as the mother of all reports, will be released tomorrow at 8:30am ET.
In The Arora Report analysis, the jobs report tomorrow is the key to the near-term direction of the stock market. If the jobs report is strong, the stock market will likely tumble. If the jobs report is weak, the stock market will likely run up. 
Weekly initial jobless claims came at 224K vs. 215K consensus. This indicates that the jobs picture is still very strong, but the data is beginning to weaken.
Q4 Productivity-Prel came at 3.2% vs. 2.1% consensus.

The non-farm payrolls report for January, anticipated before the market opens, is expected to heavily influence the day’s trading direction. A stronger-than-expected job gains report and/or any spike in wage growth could potentially reignite inflation fears, triggering selling pressure in the market.
Cues From Thursday's Trading:
Optimism preceding tech earnings and some favorable economic data contributed to gains across major averages on Thursday. The indices opened higher and remained range-bound in a sideways move until late-morning trading, with the Dow Industrials briefly dipping below the unchanged line. Subsequently, stocks initiated a rally and concluded near the session highs.
The majority of sectors displayed solid advancements during the session, illustrating the breadth of the rally, although energy stocks experienced some pullback.

Blowout Jobs Report And Earnings
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows a rally after a shallow pullback.
The chart shows that the shallow pullback approached but did not penetrate the high band of the support zone. From a technical perspective this is a positive.
The chart shows an attempt of a new breakout. This new breakout would have likely followed through if it was not for the jobs report data upsetting bulls’ hopium this morning.
The jobs report is a blowout. Here are the details:

Non-farm payrolls came at 353K vs. 175K consensus.
Non-farm private payrolls came at 317K vs. 150K consensus.
Unemployment rate came at 3.7% vs. 3.8% consensus.
Average work week came at 34.1 vs. 34.4 consensus.


This is the strongest jobs report since January 2023.
In The Arora Report analysis, this jobs report is simply too strong for the Fed to cut rates. Even though Powell was clear that a rate cut in March was not the base case, stock market bulls have continued to buy stocks on hopes of a rate cut in March.  
In The Arora Report analysis, this jobs report significantly upsets stock market bulls’ hopium. If it was not for the blowout earnings from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META), the stock market would have likely fallen by as much as 1000 DJIA points on this report.  Now the questions for prudent investors are the following:
In view of blowout earnings from AMZN and META, will the momo crowd even care about the jobs report?

Will the new narrative of momo gurus that interest rates no longer matter ring true with investors?  
Layoffs helped AMZN and META report blowout earnings. If the premarket gains hold, META and AMZN have added about $275B in market cap since they reported earnings after the close yesterday.  


META is initiating its first dividend and a $50B buyback. The addition of a dividend and the buyback to stellar earnings is resulting in META stock running up 17.15% since it reported earnings to the time of this writing. This ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['Economics', 'Federal Reserve', 'Markets', 'Trading Ideas']",0.99929,Positive,https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/36913908

In Hong Kong, the shares dipped 0.1%, while Nasdaq-listed shares climbed 3.4% to $74.25 in morning trade.
Could there be some positive news to come on Wednesday that might bring a ray of hope to beleaguered Chinese investors? 
There hasn’t been much joy for investors in Alibaba since its market debut in Hong Kong in November 2019. The shares debuted at HK$187 and climbed to a peak of HK$309 in October 2020. But since then it’s been nearly all downhill to its current level at around HK$71.

The group saw its combined worth surpass the total economic output of global cities such as New York, Tokyo, London, Los Angeles, London, Paris, Seoul, Chicago, San Francisco, Osaka and Shanghai, as highlighted by Michael Hartnett, Bank of America’s chief market strategist, in a recent note.
The stocks are now testing the “law of physics,” Bloomberg columnists John Authers and Isabelle Lee wrote on Monday. Ed Yardeni, a popular Wall Street industry veteran, said “the Mag-7 once again are sucking all the air out of the universe,” in a recent note addressing the spectacular jump of Meta Platforms.
Last Friday, the social media giant owned by Mark Zuckerberg made a historic $204-billion market value jump in a single day, the largest for any U.S. company ever.

What Happened: Brian Belski, the chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, believes that the current market risk due to the dominance of mega-cap tech stocks is being overestimated. He stated in a note on Tuesday that the risk is not as severe as some might think, reported Business Insider.
The “Magnificent 7” mega-cap tech stocks, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), currently account for 29% of the S&P 500.
Although a potential decline in demand for these stocks poses a risk, Belski is confident that the broader market can still yield positive returns even if the mega-cap tech stocks falter.
“Our work shows that the stock market has held up just fine in prior periods when the outperformance of mega-cap stocks started to wane,” Belski said.

Here’s a look at how much return an investment in a basket comprising the Magnificent seven stocks in equal proportion would have fetched vis-a-vis Cathie Wood-led Ark Investment’s flagship Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK).
New Group On The Block: FAANG was the precursor to the group, now collectively called the Magnificent Seven. Originally named FANG by Jim Cramer in 2013, the group became known as FAANG with the addition of Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in 2017. The original members were Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), which then went by the name Facebook, Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), formerly Google.
Later iterations were MAGA, which included Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) along with Apple, Alphabet and Amazon, and MAMAA, comprising Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon.
The phrase Magnificent Seven was first used by BofA Securities analyst Michael Hartnett in 2023. The constituent companies spearheaded the stock market rebound during the year, thanks to the dominant market positioning, innovativeness, brand appeal and financial muscle of these companies. This group comprises the biggest mega-cap techs including Meta, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).

S&P 500 At 5000
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that S&P 500 is comfortably above the top band of the support zone.  
The chart shows that the move up is on lower volume. This is a negative. 
Historically, when S&P 500 hits the next 1000 benchmark, the median return is as follows:

0.57% after one week
2.00% after one month
3.5% after three months
7.73% after six months


The above data is only history, and no one should depend on it. It is more important to understand how various groups behave.  

Sentiment moves higher in the extreme zone.
Momo crowd buying becomes even more aggressive.
Mom and pop who are normally not active in the stock market jump in.
Bears throw in the towel and jump in.
Underperforming money managers become aggressive buyers.
Smart money takes advantage of the strength and trims positions. 


“Buy low and sell high” is a simple concept in theory. This is exactly what you need to do to consistently beat the stock market. However, in practice it is not as easy as it sounds for the following reasons:

Human emotions of fear and greed.
Market mechanics
Market controlled by momo crowd
Momo gurus
Short squeezes
Thousands of constantly changing variables from across the globe


The key is to look at returns, not only in terms of absolute returns, but in terms of risk adjusted returns.
As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in the protection band, which strikes the optimum balance between various crosscurrents. Please scroll down to see the protection band. 

Jobless Claims
Initial Jobless Claims came at 218K vs. 218K consensus. This indicates that the jobs picture is staying strong.  Initial Jobless Claims is a leading indicator and carries heavy weight in our adaptive ZYX Asset Allocation Model with inputs in ten categories.  In plain English, adaptiveness means that the model changes itself with market conditions. Most models on Wall Street are static. They work for a while and then stop working when market conditions change.
Treasury Auction
Yesterday, we shared with you that the largest ever 10-year Treasury auction was still. Please read the Afternoon Capsule for details. 
Today, there is a $25B 30-year auction. This is not the largest auction. The largest auction was $27B.

Revised CPI
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows the revised CPI data brought in buyers to the stock market.
The chart shows that volume continues to be low. This indicates that so far there is lack of conviction in the move. However, this can change very quickly.
The stock market has been eagerly waiting for CPI revisions as there have been times in the past when such revisions caused major moves in the stock market.
A year ago, when inflation appeared to be coming down, revisions completely changed the picture.
As of this writing, the complete data is not yet available. Here are the details known so far:

Q4 Core CPI is unchanged at 3.3% annualized.
December CPI revised to 0.2% from 0.3%.
December Core CPI is unchanged at 0.3%.


Bond yields are slightly lower after the CPI revisions.
The sum total of the revision data so far is positive for the stock market.
As more data becomes available, it may move the stock market. CPI for January will be released next Tuesday at 8:30am ET.
Adding to the AI frenzy is the news that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wants to raise $5T - $7T for manufacturing AI chips. He appears to be trying to raise the money from oil rich nations.

Small Caps
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of small cap iShares Russell 2000 ETF (ARCA: IWM).
Note the following:

The chart shows the 2021 high in small caps.
The chart shows the high in small caps in 2023.
The chart shows small caps are still well below the 2021 high.
Small caps staged a big rally in 2023, but small caps have not rocketed to new highs like the S&P 500. This may be an opportunity for investors. Here is what investors should keep in mind:

IWM could be a catch up trade.
On the other hand, small caps should have performed better than they have.The difference could be explained due to the lack of high flying AI stocks in IWM, or the difference could be a warning.
Small caps are interest rate sensitive and should do well when the Fed cuts rates.
Small caps are economically sensitive. As such, small caps should do well if there is no landing.
IWM includes many banks. If there is no banking crisis, IWM should do well.
If the overall stock market maintains its gains, small caps provide an opportunity to investors.


Fed speak is ahead. The Fed’s Michelle Bowman, Tom Barkin, and Neel Kashkari will be speaking today.

Thus, Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler, believes a market correction is imminent.
“Some of the internal indicators that we produce have just given us a sell signal,” Johnson said on Monday, while appearing on Benzinga’s PreMarket Prep.

Hotter Inflation
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows a slight pullback on inflation data.
The chart shows volume continues to be low, indicating lack of conviction.
The volume today will be a tell. If the stock market pulls back on heavy volume on bad inflation data, that will be an indication that the bulls are losing control. On the other hand, if the stock market has only a shallow pullback or goes up on lower volume, that will be an indication that bulls continue to be in control.
CPI was worse than expected. Here are the details:

Headline CPI came at 0.3% month-over-month vs. 0.2% consensus.
Core CPI came at 0.4% month-over-month vs. 0.3% consensus.

Momo gurus are already being proactive to prevent a selloff if the data shows that inflation is not coming down. The new mantra of momo gurus is that stocks will go up even if inflation does not come down. Keep in mind that momo gurus’ real job is to run up the stock market under the disguise of analysis.


Momo gurus are extremely clever. Realizing that their new narrative was not that good, now they have come up with a more persuasive narrative to persuade their followers to buy stocks. The new narrative is that this rise in inflation is a one-off.
The CPI data today shows that Powell’s fear of Burns’ blunder is justified. Arthur Burns was the most intelligent Fed Chairman. He lowered rates when inflation came down but was forced to raise rates again when inflation picked up again. This is known as Burns’ blunder.
New earnings are having an impact on the stock market.

The broader Seattle area, encompassing Tacoma and Bellevue, was not spared, witnessing a nearly 93% fall in sales volume from $3.8 billion to $283.4 million.
Driving Forces Behind The Drop
This sharp decline in office property transactions can be attributed to several factors, including significant job losses in the tech sector, which is a major economic driver in the region. 
As the data showed, the Seattle area saw the tech industry shed 44,700 jobs last year, a trend expected to persist and further reduce demand for office space. Additionally, the increasing adoption of hybrid working models has negatively impacted the need for traditional office environments.

Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE: UBER).
Note the following:

The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of UBER stock is being used to illustrate the point.
The chart shows the jump up in UBER stock on the news of the buy back.
The chart shows the Arora buy zone and the power of buy zones. The example from UBER on the chart represents a profit 208%.

Below is a look at a few recent notable insider sales. For more, check out  Benzinga's insider transactions  platform.

Hartnett’s insights reveal that while every bubble is unique, they share common catalysts such as technological innovation, new markets and, notably, central bank easing. These elements have historically converged to inflate asset prices beyond sustainable levels.
The AI bubble, for example, was ignited by the Federal Reserve’s response to Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse and the subsequent rise of ChatGPT. This scenario mirrors past bubbles such as the Plaza Accord’s effect on Japan and the internet bubble fueled by the Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) crisis. 
Similarly, policy stimuli in response to the COVID-19 pandemic inflated crypto and tech stocks, reminiscent of the Mississippi and South Sea Company bubbles sparked by changes to English usury laws in 1714.

Hotter Inflation
Please click here for a chart of Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT).
Note the following:

The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of AMAT stock is being used to illustrate the point.
As we have been sharing with you, Applied Materials is the best “picks and shovels” play in artificial intelligence.
Artificial intelligence needs more sophisticated chips. To manufacture more sophisticated chips, companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE: TSM) and Intel Corp (NASDAQ: INTC) are buying more sophisticated equipment to manufacture the chips. Applied Materials is a big beneficiary.
The chart shows the big jump in AMAT stock on earnings.
RSI on the chart shows that AMAT is overbought.
The power of the demand for AI is reflected in the following earnings details from AMAT:

The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.13 vs. $1.90 consensus.
The company reported revenue of $6.71B vs. $6.48B consensus.
The company is forecasting revenue for the current quarter with a midpoint of $6.5B vs. $6.34B consensus.


The strength in AMAT is pushing tech stocks higher, especially AI stocks.
The rise in AMAT stock shows that “picks and shovels” is a great strategy.  
Producer Price Index (PPI) came hotter than expected, just as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) did on Tuesday. Here are the details:

Tepid Consumer
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT).
Note the following:

The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of WMT stock is being used to illustrate the point.
The U.S. economy is 70% consumer based, and Walmart is the largest retailer in the U.S. Therefore, investors should pay close attention to Walmart.
The chart shows the stock is going higher as of this writing.
The chart shows when Walmart reported earnings. Walmart beat earnings estimates for the last quarter. Here are the details:

Q4 revenue came at $173.4B vs. $158.4B consensus.
Walmart hit $100B in e-commerce sales.
Q1 adjusted EPS came at $1.48-$1.56 vs. $1.48 consensus.
Dividend increased by 9%.


The stock market has held up, in part, due to excess consumer spending.
Stock market bulls are counting on excess consumer spending continuing.
Walmart earnings are painting a tepid picture of the consumer. Walmart says shoppers are staying “choiceful.” The data from Walmart runs counter to stock market bulls’ hopium of the consumer continuing to spend excessively.
Walmart stock is running up, in part, because Walmart is buying Vizio Holding Corp (NYSE: VZIO) to expand advertising. VZIO is in the ZYX Buy portfolio that surrounds the Model Portfolio, and VZIO is the 191st Arora Portfolio company to be bought out.  
As we have stated before, the most critical item for the stock market is NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA) earnings. For details, please see ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['Cryptocurrency', 'Economics', 'Markets', 'General']",0.99969,Neutral,https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/37216997

The Seattle-based e-commerce giant is replacing pharmacy company Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA). In recent years, Walgreens has seen its shares plummet 28.4% in 2022; 30.1% in 2023; and 14.6% in 2024.
Amazon stock tumbled 51% in 2022 but came roaring back more than 100% since the beginning of 2023. Now it’s on deck to join DJIA — the so-called “venerable index.”
As one of Wall Street’s oldest stock indicators, the DJIA doesn’t get shaken up often. The last member to join was Walgreens in 2018 when it replaced  General Electric, which enjoyed a 111-year tenure. Still, membership carries a certain prestige. Or does it?
“I remember when this would have mattered,” Scott Nations, founder of Nations Indexes, said on social media following the announcement.

As a provider of key technology needed to develop artificial intelligence (AI) platforms, the company is strategically positioned to benefit from the ongoing AI craze. 
Jensen Huang, Nvidia's co-founder and chief executive, said during the late Wednesday call that ""a whole new industry is being formed, and that's driving our growth."" 
Investors took these words seriously, taking much of the tech sector up.
While big tech companies like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) compete to find the next groundbreaking stage in AI, companies that provide the infrastructure for those developments are the beneficiaries.
With quarterly revenues of $22.10 billion representing an increase of 265% year-over-year, Nvidia's growth was fueled by rising sales of AI infrastructure such as the H200 chip.
Analysts looking at Nvidia's performance overwhelmingly made mention of the growing market for generative AI as a motor behind the company's recent success, with several analysts raising the company's price target.
Nvidia's success in AI is pushing it close to the 2 trillion market cap, making it the third largest company by that measure. The company's $240 billion jump in market capitalization on Thursday accounts as the largest single-day jump in market history.

What Happened: Al-Rumayyan made this announcement at an investment event in Miami, sponsored by the sovereign wealth fund, reported Reuters on Thursday. He highlighted the kingdom’s energy resources and funding capabilities as key factors contributing to this potential.
“We are fairly well positioned to be an AI hub outside of the U.S.,” he said.
“AI will consume a lot of energy and we are the global leader when it comes to fossil fuel energy and when it comes to renewable energy.” 
He also emphasized that Saudi Arabia, being the world’s largest oil producer, has the “political will” and financial resources to drive AI projects.
Al-Rumayyan’s remarks suggest that data centers could be a crucial element of Riyadh’s strategy to leverage the surging demand for generative AI technology, which demands substantial processing power.

“Nvidia and the golden GPUs are the start of the spending wave…not the end.” 
The AI revolution will only intensify further, as a myriad of use cases are built out across the enterprise and consumer ecosystem, Ives said, adding that this is a “transformational tech trend” not seen since the start of the Internet in the mid 1990s.

Tesla investor and Future Fund co-founder and Managing Partner Gary Black on Thursday defended the company as one that can potentially become the number two electric-vehicle maker, behind the Elon Musk-led company.

The fund manager said Rivian has a high quality product, brand recognition, execution skills, lack of legacy ICE baggage, and competitive conditioning.
Rivian can happily co-exist with Tesla to be that strong number-two player by 2030, he said. Rivian’s brand took the top honors in owner satisfaction, based on Consumer Reports’ survey, with 86% of customers saying they would buy it again, he noted.

Thursday's bump came after the most recent earnings call; the company once again beat expected revenue and earnings per share. The numbers it is forecasting for the next quarter are also higher than many analysts expected.
Since the AI craze began in early 2023, Nvidia’s stock has risen well over 350%.
