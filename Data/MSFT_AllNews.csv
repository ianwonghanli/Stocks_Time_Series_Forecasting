With so much to consider this week, you might want to keep an eye on Wall Street’s main measure of investor jitters, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX). The index is up this morning, but it’s hanging out at just under 18. A number below 20 in this market appears to mean alarm bells aren’t really much of an issue. But there could be plenty of room for surprises this week amid so many earnings reports, a Fed meeting, and lots of economic reports.
The Week Ahead In Economic Data
This morning, we saw durable goods orders for March come in softer than expected—up 0.5% against a Briefing.com consensus forecast of a 2.0% gain. The numbers come after durable goods orders in February unexpectedly fell after a string of gains. A month ago, some economy-watchers suggested the soft February number could have been an anomaly—a nonlinear data point within an uptrend. This month’s tepid number might call into question the pace of the current recovery. Still, it was a positive number, and considering how atypical this pandemic period has been, the recovery is likely to be atypical as well.  
Tomorrow, the market is scheduled to get two February price indices for the housing market and a consumer confidence number for April from the Conference Board. Last time around, the index for March showed consumer confidence at its highest point in a year amid recovery expectations. With the vaccine rollout progressing well, in the United States at least, it could be interesting to see whether the numbers show another jump.

After the bell, the California-based EV pioneer and clean energy company Tesla is expected to report its first-quarter earnings of $0.79 per share. Elon Musk is also expected to give special attention to its Autopilot, its suite of advanced driver-assistance systems, which has been again criticized for lulling some drivers into a false sense of security and implying self-driving abilities well beyond its existing capabilities.

Despite all the fireworks, it turns out that Azure wouldn’t be MSFT’s biggest story in the quarter to follow.
The big story is arguably more complex. It’s not just MSFT’s huge $20 billion acquisition of artificial intelligence (AI) software company Nuance Communications (NASDAQ: NUAN), but the larger subplot of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) that potentially hints at an outline of MSFT’s longer-term strategy. 
M&A will likely be on peoples’ minds when the company reports fiscal Q3 earnings Tuesday, but so will the usual suspects like cloud, Office, and LinkedIn. Last time MSFT reported, fiscal Q2 Azure revenue grew 50% and total commercial cloud revenue rose 34%, setting high bars for MSFT as it prepares to report its latest financial results.
Buy Or Build? Expanding Horizons And Market Share
MSFT’s acquisition of NUAN adds another point to the buying-spree narrative that appears to be unfolding. 
Last month, MSFT bought video game holding company ZeniMax Media for $7.6 billion. Last year, the software giant was on track toward buying TikTok for $30 billion before the deal got derailed. 2016 marked the company’s largest acquisition—LinkedIn—for $26 billion. And chat app Discord just turned down MSFT’s $10 billion acquisition offer.
Each company MSFT targets represents entry into a potentially new market—or a larger footprint into an area in which the company had previously been in a more “exploratory” stage. The NUAN acquisition is kind of unique because it may give MSFT a subtle but solid foothold in the healthcare sector while boosting its capacity in AI ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['News', 'M&A', 'Earnings', 'Guidance', 'Health Care', 'Options', 'Markets', 'Tech', 'General']",0.99994,Neutral,https://amp.benzinga.com/amp/content/20793834

Again. 
It’s only been six weeks since the last Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, but they’re gathering again today. The usual press conference featuring Fed Chairman Jerome Powell comes right after the meeting ends at 2 p.m. ET tomorrow, and analysts don’t expect any change in policy. 
Trading might be a little slow ahead of all this, which is kind of typical when investors await the latest from Powell and company. Major indices didn’t move much in the overnight session. That being said, the Fed may be about the third-most important event this week after gross domestic product (GDP) and Tech earnings. 
Looking ahead to this afternoon, Tech takes center stage with earnings from Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). More on all that farther down. 
This earnings season is now about one-third finished, and 84% of companies have beaten Wall Street’s consensus earnings estimates, according to FactSet. That’s well above the average level of positive surprises, which indicates analysts may have been too conservative heading in. General Electric (NYSE: GE) did very well but the stock’s down a bit, and Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) also reports later on, which could be interesting. 
Fed Ahead As Investors Await Views On Latest Strong Data
Unlike last month, we don’t get a “dot-plot” of Fed officials’ outlooks for rates this time around. For that, we have to wait until the mid-June FOMC meeting. But Powell might be asked to comment on recent booming economic data and higher than expected inflation readings. 
The Fed puts return to a healthy jobs picture high on its list, and the last two initial jobless claims reports and March payrolls both suggested progress. It could be interesting to get Powell’s thoughts on these numbers and what they might mean going forward. 
That said, it would be very surprising to hear Powell say anything about getting more hawkish anytime soon. The Fed’s feet seem firmly planted in the dovish camp, and Fed funds futures suggest no change in rate policy this year. It’s likely Powell wants to see a few more solid jobs reports—including May payrolls—before making any new pronouncements about the employment picture. 
It’s kind of unfortunate timing that the Fed meeting concludes Wednesday—a day before Powell and the rest of us get a first look at the government’s estimate for Q1 gross domestic product (GDP) growth (see more below). Thursday also brings the weekly initial jobless claims data. 
After two solid weeks in a row, it would be good to see more improvement. However, anything under 600,000 would extend the streak of reports below that level. It’s still high, but a major improvement after months of 700,000 to 800,000 new claims a week. Before Covid, the average was well below 300,000, but it’s unclear when we’ll get back to those kinds of levels.

Cover story ""U.S. Pot Producers Are Growing Like Weeds. Here's How to Buy In"" by Max A. Cherney and Connor Smith makes a case that, while investors chased Canada's pot stocks like Tilray Inc (NASDAQ: TLRY), they ignored the faster-growing U.S. cannabis industry. Barron's believes multistate operators like Curaleaf Holdings Inc (OTC: CURLF) will flourish as state and federal obstacles fall away.
Daren Fonda's ""What Happens When Governments Go Crypto"" suggests that the rise of stablecoins as cryptocurrency is a bigger threat to established, government-backed currency than Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC).

Tech stocks rose in pre-market trading, but can they maintain those early gains? That’s one question hanging over Wall Street today. 
We’ll talk more about the trauma in Tech lower down. First, let’s take care of some data and earnings business. 
There’s more good news on the jobs front today as initial weekly jobless claims fell to 498,000, well below the 527,000 Wall Street had expected. It’s the fourth week in a row below 600,000 and the first reading below 500,000 since before the pandemic. Having the number come in below 500,000 is going to set up some high expectations for tomorrow’s nonfarm payrolls report. 
On the earnings side of things, Uber (NYSE: UBER) shares didn’t receive the same kind of love in overnight trading as competitor Lyft (NASDAQ: LYFT) did the night before. Instead, UBER turned lower after the company reported a narrower than expected quarterly loss following the close yesterday. A miss on the revenue line and hints of rising expenses might help explain why investors were less enthusiastic. Most companies missing on revenue have gotten taken out to the woodshed this earnings season.
That’s what’s happening to Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA) in pre-market trading, too. Its shares are down 5% following a miss on revenue and a beat on earnings per share for the Covid vaccine company. MRNA, along with BioNTech (NASDAQ: BNTX)—another Covid vaccine maker—might be getting hurt more by the growing momentum among global policymakers to waive patent protection for Covid vaccine makers. President Biden yesterday added his name to the list of those supporting the idea. 
Another company we’ve heard a lot about over the last year, Peloton (NASDAQ: PTON), is scheduled to report after the close one day after shares tanked following its treadmill recall. Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) and Square (NYSE: SQ) are other earnings reports to consider watching today, with ROKU another good chance to check how streaming demand is looking. “Gross payment volume,” or GPV, is a key metric to watch when you check SQ’s earnings. 
Stocks have really entered a holding pattern here. If you check the close of the S&P 500 Index (SPX) yesterday vs. its close on April 15, it’s a three-point difference. A holding pattern would probably sound good right now to anyone with lots of Tech stocks in their portfolio. The Nasdaq 100 (NDX) is down nearly 4% since April 15. 
Technically, however, both the SPX and the Nasdaq (COMP) have remained above their 50-day moving averages. Any test of those levels could be interesting to watch for signs of either buying the dip or a new wave of selling. The 50-day MA for the SPX is 4019, and for COMP is 13,513.

Well, we’ve started to observe a little more caution creeping into the market. 
It’s arguably there in bonds, where the 10-year yield continues to pivot around 1.6%, well off its March high and not getting much traction. 
It’s also evident in the Nasdaq (COMP) and Russell 2000 (RUT), both of which can’t seem to find a pathway upward. Tech shares slid again early Tuesday in pre-market trading, with “FAANG” names like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) again taking it on the chin. Palantir Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: PLTR) fell double-digits after reporting earnings, with analysts pointing to higher than expected compensation costs. 
Even though the COMP—heavily weighted toward Tech—is just 3% from all-time highs, when it ran into struggles last month it may have made some investors feel more cautious about being “all in” to stocks. We’re starting to see more interest in fixed income than earlier this year. 
Caution is also evident in the latest batch of retail investor data for April (see more below), which showed a slight pullback. 
Also, gold is up to well above $1,800 an ounce—a three-month high. It’s climbed about 10% from its 2021 lows.
One possible issue is a lack of catalysts. The big tug-of-war between growth and value continues to play out, with value winning yesterday’s battle in a huge way. Other than that, there’s not much of a story to trade on. 
Some had anticipated a strong April jobs report and thought that might provide a new storyline—namely a change in the Fed’s thinking on tapering monetary support. 
Instead we got a lackluster jobs number that kind of pushed that debate back another month, and the monetary “party” continues. Wage pressure was capped because of the jobs growth being concentrated in the leisure and hospitality sectors, something that might continue. That takes inflationary pressure off the Fed, to some extent. 
Tech laid an egg yesterday as stocks like Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) got creamed, but it’s possible some people will continue to view dips as a buying opportunity. It’s like in football. If a play keeps working, you keep running it. Running the “buy the dip” route in Tech has probably made some people a lot of money over the last year. At some point it will end, absolutely, but no one knows when that will happen. 
Some Investors Stepped Back In April
The April Investor Movement Index® (IMXSM) from TD Ameritrade showed clients tracked by the report reducing their exposure to stocks just slightly during the month. It was the first time that happened since last November. The headline number fell to 8.14 in April, down from its March score of 8.21. It’s still historically high, by the way.
The IMX is TD Ameritrade’s proprietary, behavior-based index, aggregating Main Street investor positions and activity to measure what investors actually were doing and how they were positioned in the markets.

Microsoft reached an all-time high of $263.19 in the run-up to its first-quarter 2021 earnings print. The following day, despite a big beat, Microsoft’s stock sold off almost 3% and has been in a downtrend since.

But it also seems that investors may be coming to grips with the prospect of higher prices, especially those that buy into the Fed’s view of “transitory” inflation.
The government’s April producer price index registered a 0.6% increase, ahead of a Briefing.com consensus forecast of a 0.3% gain. The PPI news comes one day after the government’s April consumer price index rose far more than expected, with the core CPI gaining 0.9% when a Briefing.com consensus had expected that inflation metric to rise just 0.3%.
The market, as gauged by equity index futures this morning, didn’t seem to react too much initially to the producer inflation data. Despite concerns about inflation, it appears that yesterday’s bad news on the inflationary front cushioned the blow of the PPI data somewhat. It may also be that the PPI news is somewhat offset by a better-than-expected reading on initial jobless claims, which came in at 473,000 when 510,000 had been expected in a Briefing.com consensus.
Rising inflation has been worrying Wall Street as investors fear the Fed may have to respond by tapering its asset purchases or raising its key interest rate sooner than expected. Inflation expectations have also been hurting growth stocks, including big tech-related names, because expectations of rising costs can dent the outlook for profitability for these companies.
The Gas Pipeline Metaphor
But at least some of this was expected. To some degree, the reopening of the economy was bound to have a “coiled spring” effect on demand, but with supply still coming online after a lengthy shutdown, it’s a mismatch that could be transitory. It’s kind of like those looking to buy gas on the East Coast. Though the pipeline has been restarted, it will be a little while before the local markets stabilize.
Despite the selling this week, it’s worth remembering that we’ve seen record highs recently, so stocks were probably due for a bit of a pullback. Some of the selling in recent weeks has been cushioned by a buy-the-dip mentality in tech stocks. While that seems like it may be the case again today, we’ll have to see if investors keep turning to that playbook.
In corporate news, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) made a U-turn on bitcoin. The electric vehicle maker has stopped accepting the cryptocurrency for automobile purchases out of concern about “rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions,” according to a tweet from CEO Elon Musk.
He said the company won’t be selling any of its bitcoin holdings and would use it for transactions “as soon as mining transitions to more sustainable energy.” Nevertheless, bitcoin was down more than 7% this morning, and other cryptocurrencies appeared to be falling in sympathy, despite Musk saying cryptocurrency is a “good idea” that “has a promising future” and adding that Tesla is looking at cryptocurrencies besides bitcoin that use less than 1% of bitcoin’s energy per transaction.

Lately, Musk’s tweets have single-handedly turned the cryptocurrency trading activity into something resembling an oscilloscope screen, with Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) and Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE) rapidly ascending and crashing based on his tweet-based whims.
But Musk doesn’t need cryptocurrency to invigorate, baffle, anger and blindside his Twitter audience. Lest we forget, here are 10 of Musk’s wildest, wooliest and weirdest tweets from his pre-crypto obsession days.

Yo, Bezos! Few corporate leaders call out their rivals by name, but Musk is not shy about dissing his competition. On Nov. 24, 2015, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) chief Jeff Bezos tweeted news of his Blue Origin aerospace subsidiary’s successful launch and landing of its reusable New Shepard rocket. However, the SpaceX honcho was unimpressed:

Musk did a follow-up tweet with a video showing SpaceX’s Falcon 9 test rig completing a divert test. For his part, Bezos ignored his competitor’s fact checking.
A Too-Hasty Exit: On Aug. 7, 2018, Musk surprised everyone — including executives at Tesla — with this tweet:

Takeaways From 13F Season: Investors who follow particular fund managers can easily look up what each was buying and selling in the quarter, but other investors may be more interested in overall themes from 13F filings. The first quarter of 2021 was a big quarter for the S&P 500, and investors were likely interested in what top managers were buying and selling to kick off 2021.

Google parent Alphabet has the attention of fund managers, with Tepper selling and Soros and Klarman buying.
ViacomCBS had a volatile quarter in part due to the unwinding of Archegos Capital, and fund managers took notice. Tepper and Soros were buying, while Klarman was selling.
Buffett continued selling financial stocks and drug stocks and reversed course by selling Chevron just one quarter after taking a stake in the oil giant.
Several fund managers traded ETFs to play particular themes. Despite inflation fears, Einhorn sold the GLD gold fund while Soros reduced his exposure to emerging markets by selling the EEM fund.

Here’s a rundown of how the smart money was playing some of the most popular stocks last quarter.

Despite not showing substantial signs of weakness, a number of institutions purchased a considerable number of puts, betting over $2.99 million the QQQ Trust Series is either headed lower or they're unsure and wanted to hedge bullish positions. This could be due to the following two possibilities:

Technology sector weakness: Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) are the top three holdings in the QQQ Trust Series 1, making up 10.94%, 9.70% and 8.38% of its total, respectively. Its largest holdings were mixed on Wednesday with Apple and Microsoft trading lower while shares of Amazon were trading higher.
Market turmoil due to a meme stock short squeeze: GameStop Corporation (NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC) soared on Wednesday, looking like another larger short squeeze could be on the horizon. When GameStop and AMC skyrocketed in January, major indexes and the QQQ Trust Series fell. Between Jan. 25 and Jan. 29, the QQQ lost 5% of its value before reversing back upwards after most meme stocks plummeted.

In unpacking why Detroit is an attractive location for entrepreneurs to locate, live and launch their companies, Benzinga spoke with Jared Stasik of Detroit Venture Partners (DVP).
Venture Dollars Flowing: Venture, nearly a decade ago, was not a big thing in Detroit.
“There was not a lot of VCs. There’s still not a lot of funds,"" said Stasik.
More and more, however, venture capital dollars are coming into Detroit. The trend began in the early 2010s, the tail end of a recession that turned the Motor City into a ghost town of sorts.
“We were able to leverage Quicken Loans, Amrock – everything associated with the residential real estate vertical – and bring all the knowledge of that space to our investments,” Stasik recollected in a discussion on initiatives, spearheaded by leaders like Dan Gilbert, that helped revitalize the city.
No longer is Detroit known only for its innovation in mobility. Through the DNA of organizations like Quicken Loans’ Family of Companies, there are opportunities for all kinds of companies.
“I think there’s a lot of fintech here, but I do really view it more as a generalist market,” Stasik added. “You’ve got companies like Bloomscape, Airspace Link, which is in govtech, providing software around drone air traffic control, Guardhat, which is in industrial ...","['Fintech', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Startups', 'Tech', 'Interview', 'General']",0.99986,Positive,https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/21657756

Major indices declined overnight amid worries about the Chinese economy, while slipping U.S. bond yields put a little pressure on things, too. 
Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) became the latest and final Wall Street banking giant to surpass analysts’ estimates with a nice earnings report, wrapping up the start of earnings season. All six of the largest U.S. banks reported profits that beat Street projections, and MS accomplished that through strong performance in both equity trading and investment banking, though overall trading results weren’t as great. 
In general, it’s impressive that the banks did so well in Q2 considering the headwinds they faced including declining bond yields and a slowdown in trading from Covid peaks. Having said that, shares of many fell as investors wondered what they could do for an encore. MS is no exception, as shares dropped more than 1% in pre-market trading. What we might have here is a case of “buy the rumor, sell the fact.”
In other earnings news, health insurer UnitedHealth (NYSE: UNH) beat every metric out there thanks in part to the fact that with Covid people aren’t going back to the doctor as they would in normal times. That means the company had less to pay out. They raised guidance, too.
Weekly initial jobless claims came in at 360,000, in line with Wall Street’s consensus.
China’s Economy Under Microscope
Pressure early Thursday could reflect a weaker than expected read on China’s economic growth, along with falling crude prices that could suggest a drop in demand. Gross domestic product in China rose 7.9% year over year in Q2, which sounds great but is a bit below the consensus view. It was down sharply from a growth of more than 18% in Q1, suggesting growth is starting to slow in the world’s second-biggest economy. 
The GDP figure got balanced out a bit by stronger than expected retail sales and industrial production for June, however. Chinese stocks actually climbed Thursday, but most of Asia and Europe fell. Some of the softness overseas could stem from Covid fears amid the Delta variant outbreak. 
Investors probably have their eyes on the bond market this morning, where the 10-year Treasury yield continues to lose ground. It fell to 1.32% this morning, down around 10 basis points from recent peaks and back near five-month lows. Falling yields can be a sign of worries about economic growth. There was a defensive tone in the market yesterday despite a pretty good performance from the Tech sector, but that in and of itself could be part of the problem, as we’ll discuss below. 
For now, it’s really all about earnings, with major indices just below all-time highs. People may wring their hands, but it’s just normal trading. We go up and we go down, and there’s no major trend to the downside based on this morning’s weakness. The yo-yo game continues, if you will. 
New Records, But Worries, Too, As Tech Dominates
Energy stocks got crushed yesterday as OPEC+ (OPEC plus Russia) found a way to settle its family spat. This could mean more crude starting to hit the market by later this year, perhaps as soon as September. Crude retreated back toward its weekly lows and is down again this morning after a surprise build in gasoline supplies reported by the U.S. government yesterday. The crude market has been volatile ever since the OPEC+ meeting ended. 
Aside from Energy softness, the market performed pretty well again Wednesday as the S&P 500 Index (SPX) hit a new all-time high just under 4400 before giving up most of its gains by the end of the day. A new record sounds impressive, and it is, but with a few caveats.

In the short-term the Fed is still the girl everyone wants to dance with.
Lately, you can almost guess where stocks are going just by checking the 10-year Treasury yield, which often moves on perceptions of what the Fed might have up its sleeve. The yield bounced back from lows this morning to around 1.32%, and stock indices climbed a bit in pre-market trading. That was a switch from yesterday when yields fell and stocks followed suit. Still, yields are down about six basis points since Monday, and stocks are also facing a losing week.
It’s unclear how long this close tracking of yields might last, but maybe a big flood of earnings due next week could give stocks a chance to act more on fundamental corporate news instead of the back and forth in fixed income.
Meanwhile, retail sales for June this morning basically blew Wall Street’s conservative estimates out of the water, and stock indices edged up in pre-market trading after the data.
Headline retail sales rose 0.6% compared with the consensus expectation for a 0.6% decline, and with automobiles stripped out, the report looked even stronger, up 1.3% vs. expectations for 0.3%. Those numbers are incredibly strong and show the difficulty analysts are having in this market.  The estimates missed consumer strength by a long shot. However, it’s also possible this is a blip in the data that might get smoothed out with July’s numbers. We’ll have to wait and see.
Caution Flag Keeps Waving
Yesterday continued what feels like a “risk-off” pattern that began taking hold earlier in the week, but this time Tech got caught up in the selling, too. In fact, Tech was the second-worst performing sector of the day behind Energy, which continues to tank on ideas more crude could flow soon thanks to OPEC’s agreement.
We already saw investors embracing fixed income and “defensive” sectors starting Tuesday, and Thursday continued the trend. When your leading sectors are Utilities, Staples, Real Estate, the way they were yesterday, that really suggests the surging bond market’s message to stocks is getting read loudly and clearly.
This week’s decline in rates also isn’t necessarily happy news for Financial companies. That being said, the Financials fared pretty well yesterday, with some of them coming back after an early drop. It was an impressive performance and we’ll see if it can spill over into Friday.
Energy helped fuel the rally earlier this year, but it’s struggling under the weight of falling crude prices. Softness in crude isn’t guaranteed to last—and prices of $70 a barrel aren’t historically cheap—but crude’s inability to consistently hold $75 speaks a lot. Technically, the strength just seems to fade up there. Crude is up slightly this morning but still below $72 a barrel.
Losing Steam?
All of the FAANGs lost ground yesterday after a nice rally earlier in the week. Another key Tech name, chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), got taken to the cleaners with a 4.4% decline despite a major analyst price target increase to $900. NVDA has been on an incredible roll most of the year.

The pullback has been attributed to inflation worries and increased spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant, but for bullish investors a pullback prior to big tech earnings allows for a sigh of relief because a run-up into earnings often becomes a ""sell the news"" event.
The three largest holdings in the SPY ETF consolidated Friday. Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), which makes up 5.52% of the SPY, closed slightly lower while Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), at 5.28%, failed to get follow-through on a new all-time high and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), at 3.8%, closed down over 1%.
While a number of bullish options traders purchased call contracts of the SPY, the Friday afternoon trades skewed overwhelmingly toward the bears. Together bearish traders bet over $9.12 million the SPY has room to fall further.

Why It’s Important: When a sweep order occurs, it indicates the trader wanted to get into a position quickly and is anticipating an imminent large move in stock price. A sweeper pays the market price for the call or put option instead of placing a bid, which sweeps the order book of multiple exchanges to fill the order immediately.
These types of option orders are usually made by institutions, and retail investors can find watching for sweepers useful because it indicates “smart money” has entered into a position.
The SPY Trades: Below is a look at the notable options alerts, courtesy of Benzinga Pro:

At 12:36 p.m., a trader executed a put sweep near the ask of 4,521 SPY options with a strike price of $355 expiring on Aug. 20. The trade represented a $194,403 bearish bet for which the trader paid 43 cents per option contract.

Wall Street continues to show signs of tracking the bond market, and bond yields posted fresh five-month lows this morning.
Daily cases have tripled from a month ago in the U.S., and travel stocks are taking it on the chin today in pre-market trading. Airlines, hotels, casinos, and restaurants all could receive the brunt of the blow if Covid worries keep growing. Other companies aren’t immune. The outbreak is generally worse overseas, which could threaten business for multinational U.S. firms. Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) and General Motors (NYSE: GM) both slid ahead of the bell. 
As Covid concerns return to Page 1 of the morning news, we might see the return of one of last year’s trends, where markets settle down during the middle of the week but fear creeps in by the end of the week and into the weekend. On Friday the major indices closed on their lows—typically a bad sign from a technical standpoint—and like many weeks during the height of the pandemic, Friday’s weakness carried over into the new week.  
Eyeing The Horsemen Of Risk
The 10-year Treasury yield fell below 1.25% to new five-month lows early Monday. Crude fell below $70 a barrel for the first time since June 11. Part of the crude weakness might reflect the OPEC+ deal reached over the weekend, but it also could suggest fears of a slowing economy if the pandemic stays front and center. 
Keep an eye on volatility, too. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) put on some steam late last week and that spilled over into Monday. It’s back above 21 this morning, a move that’s probably going to get some notice. A higher VIX often can signal people taking protection against possible market turbulence. 
Weirdly, the dollar is rising here even as bond yields fall. This could reflect people thinking the U.S. is being hit less hard by this fresh Covid outbreak. 
As Monday continues, we’ll see if the market action here is one of those things where weekend fears lead to an initial reaction and then cooler heads prevail, or if concerns continue to weigh. The “buy the dip” mentality has been so strong lately, it’s hard to believe it would suddenly fade. The question is, at what level does it happen? The 4280 level in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) could be an important one to watch. 
What’s On The Earnings Tap?
Oddly, earnings seem almost like a second-tier story today even though we’re heading into the thick of the season with 76 S&P 500 companies reporting. Things kick off with Big Blue, IBM (NYSE: IBM) expected to report this afternoon. 
A host of other big names step to the plate this week including Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), American Express (NYSE: AXP), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), Twitter (NYSE: TWTR), United Airlines (NASDAQ: UAL), AT&T (NYSE: T), Verizon (NYSE: VZ), American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL), and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). 
Something to consider as these companies report is the impact of rising producer prices, and whether this could be clipping margins or causing them to pass along costs to consumers. Reopening is also in focus, so listen for executives’ thoughts on how that’s going.

The Delta variant raised questions about the strength of the recovery, and stocks that stood to benefit most from an economic revival—including travel firms—received the hardest blow.
At the same time, falling interest rates helped knock the Financial sector deep into the red, and a 7% collapse in crude prices (see chart below) slammed the brakes on Energy stocks. Both sectors had already been under pressure over the last month, but Monday was the steepest plunge yet, with Energy falling nearly 4% and Financials dropping 3%.

CHART OF THE DAY: OIL’S SLIPPERY SLOPE. Crude oil futures (/CL—candlestick) fell to their 100-day simple moving average (blue line) at $66.21 per barrel, which coincides with a previous resistance-turned-support level of around $66. Data source: CME Group. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  
Defensive sectors like Staples, Real Estate, and Health Care also took a beating, but not as badly as the reopening and cyclical parts of the market. At the same time, strength could be found in a few of the well-known Tech firms like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). They all traded in the green even as the broader indices got slammed, perhaps in hope that Tech could outperform other sectors if this slowdown continues. That would echo what we saw last year when the pandemic first shocked the markets. 
Another echo is how some of the buying and selling shaped up across other sectors. Payment processing companies saw their stocks fall sharply on worries about consumer demand getting clipped, but grocery store stocks were among the leaders today, perhaps amid thoughts that people might drive to stores to load up on staples. We saw that kind of bifurcation back in March 2020, as well. 
On a positive note, some of the selling dried up in the final minutes of the session and major indices finished off their lows. This could be a positive going into tomorrow, but consider monitoring the futures market tonight and tomorrow morning to see if selling returns. 
Importantly, the S&P 500 Index (SPX) managed to come back from below its 50-day moving average to close solidly above that level. This suggests that maybe the “buy the dip” mentality that’s characterized the market so much in 2021 hasn’t vanished.

Early on, it looks like they might get their wish. Major indices rebounded overnight after the worst day in 10 months, with some of the “reopening” stocks that got pounded yesterday showing signs of a “turnaround Tuesday.” The key could end up being what happens after the first 30 minutes of trading. Spillover from the overnight session may carry things higher at first, but then we’ll see if there’s any continued momentum for the rest of the day. 
Two of the factors that helped lead things down yesterday popped up just a bit this morning, which may be why stocks turned green in pre-market trading. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed a fraction but remains below 1.2%, and crude oil also made a tiny move higher but is still trading below $67 a barrel. Weakness in yields and crude yesterday were seen by some as signals of possible slowing economic growth. 
It also helps to see Big Blue—IBM (NYSE: IBM)—reporting a strong quarter after the close yesterday. The company beat analysts’ estimates on top- and bottom-lines, and the CEO said IBM sees continued signs of strength in the cloud market and customer demand. Shares are up more than 3% in the pre-market. Travelers (NYSE: TRV) also had a good quarter and saw shares rebound, which may be sending positive vibes.
As we’ve talked about before, the “buy the dip” mentality appears to remain in place. People, like sports teams, tend to keep running the play that’s been working, and lately, it’s worked a lot. We’ll see if it picks up some momentum. But remember: past isn’t prologue, and complacency and trading are like oil and water. 
Volatility, Delta Variant, Earnings Among Things to Watch
After a day like yesterday it’s arguably fair to say we’re far from out of the woods. First of all, when the market takes a smack in the face like that there are often reverberations for days or even weeks. Volatility is a little lower this morning, but the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is still above 21 after falling into the mid-teens recently. Anything above 20 could signal worries of turbulence ahead, though it’s probably constructive that VIX never got anywhere near 30 yesterday. 
Also, the Delta variant of Covid—which appeared to help trigger much of yesterday’s selling by speculators—hasn’t gone anywhere. Yesterday’s U.S. caseload was the highest daily count since early May, according to media reports. Major indices fell in Asia overnight but rose in Europe. 
Earnings season officially started last week, but will accelerate in the days to come. This afternoon and tomorrow morning are expected to bring results from Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), United Airlines (NASDAQ: UAL), and Chipotle (NYSE: CMG), among others. Those three could give investors a well-rounded look into how factors like higher prices, the Delta variant, and reopening are playing into consumer preferences. With Netflix, ...","['News', 'Earnings', 'Government', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Regulations', 'Guidance', 'Retail Sales', 'Restaurants', 'IPOs', 'Global', 'Markets', 'Tech', 'Media', 'General']",0.79477,Neutral,https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/22062639

Show host Logan Ross informed viewers Draper bought 30,000 Bitcoin at an average price of $600 and that the venture capitalist is typically right.
“I’m wrong more than I’m right,” Draper said, despite being up over $1 billion on his Bitcoin purchase.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) leads the way with a market cap of $2.38 trillion, followed by Microsoft at $2.09 trillion, Saudi Aramco at $1.86 trillion, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) at $1.79 trillion and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) at $1.75 trillion.

Here are some potential companies that could close in on the milestone in the near term or long term.

The next closest company to the $1 trillion milestone is Tencent Holdings ADR (OTC: TCEHY). The company is the largest gaming company in the world with ownership of several gaming subsidiaries and also minority investments in others.

Overall revenue came in strong at $55.3 billion, up 34% year over year, with each business segment topping expectations by a wide margin except for one that matched consensus. Jumping off its earnings performance, GOOGL shares currently stand 11% higher than they were entering last quarter’s reporting period.
Let’s take a step back for a moment. For a company whose $1 trillion market cap has only a handful of peers in the world, you have to wonder how much more growth is possible, especially considering that GOOGL seems to be in every global market, driving some part of every sector and every industry.
Still, its appetite for growth and innovation is what seems to rejuvenate the 23-year old company. And its forward outlook in its earnings conference call, courtesy of CEO Sundar Pichai, could reflect the scope of the company’s present operations and future ambitions—literally and “virtually,” all over the map.
Core Search Still Globally Uncontested
Almost everyone in the world uses the term “Google″ as a verb synonymous with “online search.” This speaks to GOOGL’s dominance in the minds of online users—around 92% of all global search queries go through the Google search engine. 
Not surprisingly, the company has owned over 30% of the global online ad market share since at least 2016, according to Statista, and in the US, that figure is expected to rise to 56.8% this year.
These are important stats, not only because ad revenue represents 82% of GOOGL’s total revenue—in other words, it pays the bills—but because it’s also what makes the company’s forays into other avenues of growth possible.
As is often the case going into GOOGL earnings, ad revenue growth will likely be on investors’ minds. As earnings approach, the Street appears optimistic about GOOGL’s Q2 ad results.

A week later, things feel very different as earnings continue to hold the day.
We’re on pace for the S&P 500 Index (SPX) to be up 1% for the week if things don’t head lower today, which is pretty amazing when you consider what happened Monday. It arguably indicates how much resilience remains in the market. A positive session today, if it happens, would be the fourth straight. 
The big comeback since Monday has been powered by solid earnings across a bunch of different industries. Twitter (NASDAQ: TWTR) and Snap (NYSE: SNAP) got in on the fun, perhaps setting the table for Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and other tech giants next week. Strong user growth reported by SNAP helped lift shares in pre-market trading, and TWTR shares rose after the company reported revenue that exceeded the average analyst estimate. 
If there’s a soft spot so far, it’s arguably in the semiconductor area. Both Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) failed to impress investors with their outlooks, and shares of both are playing defense. 
Aside from that, we’ve seen nice reports this week from across a wide range of industries, including Health Care, Tech, and this morning in Financials as American Express (NYSE: AXP) appeared to impress with its results. It’s still very early and a lot could change, with next week representing the peak of reporting season. Things are off to a nice start with some of the heavyweights, though, including quarterly performance and the majority of company outlooks. 
Another good thing to see early today is the 10-year Treasury yield popping back up and knocking on the door of 1.3% again, which in theory could help Financials. Meanwhile, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) is back below 17. That’s after it jumped to nearly 25 on Monday. Now it’s down to where it spent most of its time a week or two ago before the craziness began. 
If there’s anything that could potentially knock stocks off their pedestal, it might be worries about China’s continued regulatory crackdown. Shares of China’s ride-sharing firm DiDi (NYSE: DIDI) fell sharply in pre-market trading after Bloomberg reported that Beijing is considering harsh penalties for the company. Shares of some other Chinese companies listed in the U.S. are also getting hurt before the open. So far, this weakness doesn’t appear to be spilling into the broader market, but keep an eye on it just in case. 
Mega-Caps Bask In Their Gains
If you want to sum up Thursday’s action on Wall Street, maybe it’s fair to say the mega-caps are back. 
We’re talking Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), all members of the $1 trillion market-cap club, advancing more than 1% even as the broader market barely budged. ...","['News', 'Earnings', 'Government', 'Regulations', 'Guidance', 'Retail Sales', 'Small Cap', 'Federal Reserve', 'Tech', 'Media', 'General']",0.99998,Negative,https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/22125537

The software giant is now one of only two companies in the world—the other being Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)—to boast a $2 trillion market cap, and one of only five companies across the globe, the other three being Saudi Aramco, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG), to be part of the trillionaire club.
Since CEO Satya Nadella took the helm in 2014, MSFT’s share price is up more than 600%. After reaching $500 billion in market cap in 2017, it took only two years to double to $1 trillion and then two more years to double again to $2 trillion. The next trillion, if we get there, is now only half the distance away.
MSFT is expected to report fiscal Q4 earnings on Tuesday after markets close.
When you look at MSFT from a 40,000-foot view, it seems pretty clear that the company has reinvented itself several times since taking root in software. Now a multi-industry behemoth weaving itself across the entire digital domain from ground to digital sky, MSFT arguably has become virtually omnipresent.
And its recent market-cap surge reflects the opportunities it saw and seized: investing in cloud computing, developing virtual chat and collaboration tech, expanding into the video game market, and satiating its large appetite for acquisitions.
Before looking at some of the segments, it’s important to note that MSFT has beaten Wall Street’s consensus on earnings and revenue each of the last four quarters. Accelerating business IT spending could help bring another strong quarterly result this time around, analysts told Barron’s recently.

FIGURE 1: LIFTED BY THE CLOUD. Microsoft’s stock (MSFT—candlestick) has, for the most part, been in line with the Nasdaq-100 Index (NDX—purple line). The stock has been trending higher since Sept. 2020. Will MSFT’s trend continue when it releases its quarterly earnings? Data source: Nasdaq.

Microsoft’s Cloud Stack May Emerge As Its Largest Business Segment

After the close today, investors can look forward to a tech triple-header as Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL),  Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) open the books on their latest quarters. Following that, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) earnings loom tomorrow afternoon, and along the way there’s a Fed meeting.
Things don’t calm down Thursday, either, with Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stepping to the plate that afternoon following the government’s first look at Q2 gross domestic product in the morning.
In all, that should be enough trillion-dollar companies, data, and Fed talk to keep everyone busy. Tech results certainly could exert a major influence on the market as a whole, depending on how they do. Other key companies reporting over the next few days are expected to include Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), Ford (NYSE: F), Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), Merck (NYSE: MRK), and Boeing (NYSE: BA), none of which are exactly ones you can ignore.
Early on this week as the “mega-cap” Tech companies report, it will be interesting to see if the big Tech names move in one direction and pull the broader market with them, or if they offset each other. If it’s the second scenario, the broader indices might not have much direction, considering the power these mega-caps have to pull things one way or the other. If there’s a tug-of-war, the big indices might not move much.
The wild card could be the Fed meeting, which comes in the middle of all this. Wednesday’s Fed meeting conclusion is at 2 p.m. ET, followed by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference. Sometimes the market trades in a tight range ahead of a Fed meeting, but it’s unclear if that will be the case this time considering there’s no expectation from Wall Street analysts of any policy moves by the central bank. 
Tesla Throws Out The First Pitch
Monday had its own earnings headline as Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) got things started after the close. Shares inched up just a little after the company beat analysts’ average expectations on the top- and bottom-lines, but the stock has basically been in a holding pattern much of the year between $600 and $700 a share and remains there for now. The beat on earnings looked pretty strong, but revenue wasn’t much above consensus. 
Still, the fact that TSLA shares rose at all after earnings had to be a bit of relief considering shares fell immediately after it reported the previous period’s results despite having its first $1 billion earnings quarter. Focus this time out centers on TSLA’s progress in China, a key market for the company where competition is growing. 
As Reuters reported, for the first time since late 2019, TSLA’s profits didn’t rely on sales of environmental credits to other automakers, a potential sign of increasing financial health for the manufacturing ...","['News', 'Earnings', 'Guidance', 'Global', 'Federal Reserve', 'Tech', 'General']",1.0,Neutral,https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/22173912

The report broke down unusual trading activity from members of Congress and also showed the members who beat the returns of the S&P 500.
Here are the highlights of the report.
What Happened: The year 2022 was the worst for the S&P 500, as tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY), since 2008.
Despite the bad returns for the overall market, 26 members of Congress beat the S&P 500 with their 2022 return, according to a new detailed report from Unusual Whales.
In 2022, 131 members of Congress filed stock and options trading disclosures. This figure was down from 147 members in 2021. The report tracked $788 million in trades from more than 12,700 transactions. The number of transactions was similar to 2021, with around $189 million less traded in 2022 than the previous year.
The report found House Republicans had more than 1,000 fewer trades in 2022. House Democrats had over 1,000 more trades in 2022 compared to the previous year.
Democrats saw an average return of -1.76% and Republicans saw an average return of 0.4%, both beating the -18% return of the S&P 500 in 2022.
Over the past 10 years, about 10% of fund managers outperformed the S&P 500, according to SPIVA data, while in 2022, about 5% of total Congress outperformed.
When just comparing the Congressional members who traded — just 131 of the possible 535 — 26 beat the market. That equates to 20%, a much higher rate than professional money managers over time.
Here were the top 10 members of Congress by 2022 return, according to the report:

A recent interview from OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman could provide some answers to the direction OpenAI is headed and what its relationship with Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT) means.
What Happened: OpenAI is the parent company of ChatGPT, a chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to answer questions. The technology is being experimented with by many, including actor Ryan Reynolds to create a commercial.
The technology and use cases of OpenAI have also attracted the attention of Microsoft, which is looking to invest $10 billion in the company and help use it to power its Bing search engine to take on search leader Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL).
Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI in 2019 and has maintained a relationship with the company since.
In an interview with TechCrunch, Altman said the current deal with Microsoft is non-exclusive.
Altman went a step further and said that OpenAI can build its own software products and services along with licensing out its technology.
There have been rumblings of OpenAI competing with Google’s search engine.

Here's a look at what to expect from the tech giant, which tripled down on its investment in Open AI, the company behind ChatGPT, just a day ahead of earnings. 
What To Know: Microsoft is expected to report fiscal second-quarter earnings of $2.30 per share on quarterly revenue of $52.96 billion, according to average analyst estimates from Benzinga Pro.
In the company's fiscal first quarter, Microsoft reported earnings of $2.35 per share, topping analyst estimates of $2.32 per share. The company also turned in better-than-expected revenue results when it reported a top-line figure of $50.122 billion, which was up 11% on a year-over-year basis.
On Microsoft's conference call following the report, the Redmond, Washington-based company warned that it anticipated a 5% drop in Azure growth, so cloud computing will be an area to watch. Cloud services revenue was up 35% in the first quarter. 
Microsoft chairman and CEO Satya Nadella also noted the company planned to manage costs while investing in key growth areas.

Microsoft reported fiscal second-quarter adjusted EPS of $2.32, beating consensus analyst estimates of $2.29. Revenue of $52.75 billion missed consensus analyst estimates of $52.94 billion. Revenue was up 2% from a year ago.
Microsoft's 2% revenue growth was its slowest in any quarter since 2016. Revenue from Azure and other cloud services was up 31% from a year ago, down from 35% in the previous quarter and roughly in-line with analyst expectations.
The company also reported a $1.2-billion charge related to its recent decision to lay off 10,000 workers, restructure its hardware portfolio and consolidate leases.
Looking ahead, Microsoft guided for fiscal third-quarter revenue of between $50.5 billion and $51.5 billion, missing analyst projections of $52 billion.

Analyst Color: 
Microsoft’s commentary on the earnings call worried the market, which is so intensely concerned about economic growth, LPL Financial chief global strategist Quincy Crosby  said in a note. The message from Microsoft’s management was “the economy is slowing, and their customers are more cautious about spending,” the analyst said.
“There’s still a long way to go during the reporting season, but guidance is becoming even more important than it was before last night’s Microsoft earnings call,” he added.

Here's a quick rundown of the report and why analysts were pointing to a ""loaded"" second half of the year.
What Happened: IBM reported fourth-quarter revenue of $16.69 billion, which beat average analyst estimates of $16.4 billion, according to Benzinga Pro. The company said its top-line results were flat on a year-over-year basis.
IBM's fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $3.60 per share were in line with consensus estimates.
IBM guided for full-year 2023 revenue growth in the mid-single digit range and said it expected consolidated free cash flow to increase by about $1 billion this year.
Analyst Reactions: Most analysts seemed to be in agreement following IBM's quarterly results: it's still a ""show-me story,"" Morgan Stanley said.
Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring reiterated IBM with an Equal-Weight rating and a $143 price target, noting the firm remained cautious on the credit side of the business given the company's valuation.
The fourth-quarter results and first-quarter guide were largely in line with Morgan Stanley's expectations.

The investment could see Google positioning itself in the artificial intelligence race, but it might also come with some baggage.
What Happened: Google is investing $300 million in artificial intelligence company Anthropic.

Anthropic announced a partnership with Google Cloud on its website.
“We’re partnering with Google Cloud to support the next phase of Anthropic, where we’re going to deploy our AI systems to a larger set of people,” Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said. “This partnership gives us the cloud infrastructure performance and scale we need.”

Cues From Monday’s Trading: 
The major U.S. averages ended Monday’s session lower, extending the losses from the previous session. Skittish traders liquidated stocks after bond yields surged on fears that the fed funds rate would continue to rise in the wake of recent strong economic data.

Stocks opened the session lower and experienced volatility in early trading, dropping to their intra-day lows by late morning trading. After cutting some losses, the S&P 500 Index and the Nasdaq Composite continued to languish in the red before closing notably lower.
The 30-stock Dow Industrials managed to sneak above the unchanged line in early afternoon trading but pulled back soon after and closed modestly lower.
Technology, communication services and material stocks were among the worst decliners on Monday. On the other hand, defensive utility stocks bucked the downtrend.

The Activision Blizzard Takeaways: Hickey highlights a strong back catalog for Activision Blizzard as it faces the uncertainty of a pending acquisition by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT).
“Investors are reengaging on ATVI’s fundamental growth opportunity as growth accelerate and the MSFT deal has become increasingly uncertain as regulatory wrestling may exhaust motivation,” the analyst said.

Many of the trades disclosed by Pelosi have shown questionable timing ahead of new policy changes and bills from Congress.

The major averages opened the session notably lower after Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari  spooked the market with his view that more rate hikes may be needed.

Energy, communication services, technology and material stocks moved strongly to the upside, while defensive consumer staple and real estate stocks came under modest selling pressure.

Here’s what Cuban thinks of ChatGPT.
What Happened: ChatGPT made headlines in 2023 with the chatbot seeing increased engagement and parent company OpenAI commanding a $10 billion investment from Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT). Microsoft is using ChatGPT to help revive its Bing search engine and compete with Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)-owned Google search engine.
While ChatGPT has been shown to pass major tests and exams, some have issued warning signs about the dangers that artificial intelligence can have.
Cuban is among those sounding the alarm on potential issues with ChatGPT.
“It’s gonna get worse,” Cuban said. “If you play with ChatGPT at all, the next battle isn’t about Twitter, control of Twitter, it’s who controls the AI models and the information that goes in them.”

Altman grew up in St. Louis, Missouri and learned how to program thanks to taking apart a Macintosh computer at the age of 8.
Altman has founded several companies, including OpenAI, and pushed forth the growth of artificial intelligence. The entrepreneur argues that artificial intelligence is coming and people need to figure out how to live with it. 
Here are five things you might not know about Sam Altman.
College Dropout: Altman, 37, attended Stanford University, studying computer science for two years before dropping out. Altman dropped out to work on Loopt, a mobile app company he co-founded full-time.
While Altman didn’t finish school at Stanford, he would be welcomed back years later to give lectures at the school. Altman taught a series called “How to Start a Startup” in 2014.
Y Combinator: Altman is well-known for his connection to startup accelerator Y Combinator. Altman’s company Loopt was one of the first eight companies funded by Y Combinator. Each of the eight startups received $6,000 per founder. Reddit was also in the first batch of eight companies.
Loopt was sold for $43 million in 2012 to Green Dot, years after reaching a valuation of $175 million.
After Loopt, Altman continued to be connected to Y Combinator, investing money into companies as part of a new venture fund called Hydrazine Capital. Altman invested in the Series B funding round of Reddit.
In 2014, Altman became the president of Y Combinator.

Opportunities Ahead But Be Astute
Please click here for a chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

Plenty of opportunities are ahead in 2024, but you need to be astute as to when to buy, what to buy, and how to buy if you want market beating returns.  
The chart shows that during the Santa Claus rally, the stock market did not hit the top band of the resistance zone. In the very short term, this is a negative.
The chart shows the stock market has pulled back to the low band of the resistance zone. To maintain bullish posture, the stock market needs to not go much below the bottom band of the resistance zone.
There are likely many stops right below the bottom band of the resistance zone.  If the stock market starts dropping, hunt and destroy algorithms will go into action and take out the stops. This is the reason that The Arora Report recommends not placing stops at obvious points.
Historically, after the stops are taken out, there is a bounce. Officially, the period for the Santa Claus rally will end at the close tomorrow.
RSI shown on the chart is on a sell signal, but the pattern is such that it can quickly reverse to a buy signal.
RSI on the chart shows negative divergence. In plain English, this means that RSI and the price are moving differently. This is a negative in the very short term.
In the early trade this morning, there is considerable tax related selling. Historically, such selling is common after a strong year. The reason is that investors did not want to sell in 2023 to avoid paying capital gains taxes for the 2023 tax year.  By selling now, they have successfully postponed paying capital gains tax by one year.
As the year starts, investors are again making the classic mistake that we warned you about late last year. The classic mistake investors make at this time of the year is to act on the following:

2024 year end targets from Wall Street strategists
Sector recommendations from Wall Street strategists


In our 40 years in the markets, a vast majority of the time, Wall Street strategists are wrong. To understand the recent history, consider the following:

Right now, investors are worshiping permabulls and deriding permabears.
In 2023 at the start of the new year, investors were worshiping permabears and deriding permabulls. What did the stock market do? The stock market went up.
In 2022 at the start of the new year, investors were worshiping permabulls and deriding permabears. What did the stock market do? The stock market went down.

Cramer stated, “My crystal ball suggests that profits will be taken from the best of the best, including the Magnificent Seven and friends, as well as the richly valued software enterprise names. I think investors will use that cash to invest in companies that haven’t gotten any respect for ages.”

New Economic Data
Please click here for a chart of Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ: QQQ).
Note the following:

The chart shows tech stocks have fallen back into the support zone.
RSI on the chart shows tech stocks are near oversold.
The stock market has a consensus now that everything is going to be immaculate – the landing, the Fed, interest rates, earnings, adoption of AI, Russia, China, and the Middle East.
The stock market is assuming a 90% probability of seven rate cuts.
The stock market is going to face new economic data today:

ISM Manufacturing Index will be released at 10am ET. The consensus is 47.1%.
JOLTS report will be released at 10am ET.


The stock market will also face minutes from the last FOMC meeting at 2pm ET. Powell was dovish in the press conference, flipping 180 degrees. At The Arora Report, we will be reading the Fed minutes to see if the 180 degree flip was unanimous or if there was dissension.
If the new data and the Fed minutes are supportive of immaculate everything, expect a rip roaring rally and new highs.
If the data is not supportive of immaculate everything, expect momo gurus to come up with a new narrative to try to run up the stock market.
Market mechanics are neutral as of this writing in the premarket but can easily swing in either direction after the data and Fed minutes.
Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin has made two key points this morning:

Rate hikes are not off the table.
The soft landing is at risk.


As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in the protection band, which strikes the optimum balance between various crosscurrents. Please scroll down to see the protection band.

At the CES technology trade show, Nvidia, a U.S. company, has maintained its lead in this market since last year. 
The company revealed three new GPUs – RTX 4060 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4080 Super – designed for AI-ready laptops, the Nikkei Asia reports. 
These chips are featured in Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung models. Nvidia’s AI chips, including the high-end A100 and H100 models, have gained traction, particularly with the rise of generative AI, like ChatGPT. 
However, their top chips face U.S. export restrictions to China, though the newly announced GPUs are exempt from these curbs.
In contrast, AMD and Intel are betting on AI personal computers (PCs), which embed AI chips for local AI model processing. 
This strategy differs from Nvidia’s focus on server-based AI, relying on data centers. 
At CES, both companies unveiled processors specifically for AI PCs. These chips feature a dedicated neural processing unit (NPU), offering enhanced data privacy, longer battery life, and expanded AI applications compared to regular PCs.

During the previous month, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) surged by 3.4% compared to the previous year, surpassing the forecasted 3.2% increase. Core inflation stood at 3.9% annually, exceeding the expected 3.8%, primarily driven by the persistent high costs of shelter.
Latest Fed remarks had a chilling effect on the markets. Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin indicated his willingness to consider rate reductions once inflation is on track to reach 2%, while Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester expressed the view that March might be too early for a rate cut.
In response, traders adjusted their expectations for interest rates, with the implied probability of a March rate cut falling from 70% to around 63%, while maintaining their overall bet of six rate cuts throughout 2024.
Meanwhile, Treasury yields remained relatively stable, while the U.S. dollar strengthened by 0.2%.

The firm’s deputy CIO, Dan Suzuki, believes that the current market signals could lead to a significant shift in investment dynamics.
What Happened: Richard Bernstein Advisors (RBA) has been signaling a potential investment opportunity amidst concerning signs in the stock market, reported Business Insider. The firm has been predicting a “once-in-a-generation” opportunity for months, and it appears to be on the verge of realization.
According to RBA’s Deputy CIO Dan Suzuki, the market’s current situation, particularly the dominance of a few stocks, could lead to a broader market shift. The firm’s thesis, proposed at the end of last year, suggests that the extraordinary market leadership of a small group of stocks will expand to the wider market, resulting in stronger gains for the other 493 S&P 500 stocks.
However, Suzuki warned that the corporate earnings of major tech companies are expected to decelerate in the next quarter.

Here's a look at the history of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and how much an investment at launch would be worth today.
What Happened: Launched with seed funding of $6.5 million, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust became the first U.S. ETF on Jan. 22, 1993.
The ETF was approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission several years after State Street Corp. (NYSE:STT) applied for the fund.
Initial interest in the ETF was poor and the fund was almost closed before investors came around to the idea of using ETFs as investment vehicles.
The success of the SPY ETF led to other financial institutions launching similar ETFs that track the S&P 500 Index, one of the largest and most well-known stock market indexes.

The BITO TradeOn Monday, Ark Invest offloaded 648,091 units of BITO, worth $12.6 million, a move that aligns with Wood’s recent strategy of focusing more on their own Bitcoin ETF, ARKB. The BITO units were sold through ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSE:ARKW), while ARKB units were purchased through the same fund.
This decision comes amidst a dynamic cryptocurrency market, as detailed in a recent Benzinga report.

(NASDAQ:AMD) shares experienced a significant surge in 2023, driven by the increasing demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications. However, the stock’s future trajectory has now been thrown into uncertainty as an analyst downgraded AMD’s rating to a rather unconventional status.
What Happened: The Northland Capital Markets analyst Gus Richard downgraded AMD’s rating to a “heck if we know” status, citing the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company’s AI-oriented GPUs, CNBC reported on Monday. This downgrade comes after AMD’s stock rose by nearly 130% in 2023, with investors banking on the company’s AI-oriented GPUs to rival those of Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and attract major buyers like Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:FB).
Richard’s decision is based on the “irrational exuberance” surrounding the growth of AI chip demand, which has led to inflated expectations. He predicts a total AI chip revenue of $125 billion in 2027, with some analysts estimating it to be as high as $400 billion.

Yet, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) believe the rate of transformation will be slower than expected, as it's still not economically feasible for companies to replace employees with an AI system.
The researchers developed a model to calculate the cost of building an AI system that would replace a worker's tasks. They used it to understand whether it would make sense for the company to replace that worker with a machine. 
The conclusion: human labor is still cheaper in most cases.
Job Displacement By AI Is A Valid Concern
Disruptions to the labor markets rank high amongst concerns stemming from the rapid development of AI.
In May of last year, a survey commissioned by Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) found 49% of workers were worried that AI would take their jobs. That fear reached 60% of workers who are already using AI to complement their daily tasks, as per a separate survey from December.
Their worries are not unfounded. 
All through 2023, news reports and financial analyses consistently predicted that the impact of AI in the workplace would be substantial. A Goldman Sachs report from last year put at least 300 million full-time jobs at risk of automation by generative AI.
Earlier this month, the International Monetary Fund warned that at least 40% of jobs ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['News', 'Markets', 'Tech', 'ETFs', 'General']",0.62202,Negative,https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/36744236

Wedbush rates Microsoft outperform. It also maintains a $450 price target, while Nvidia is rated outperform with a $600 price target.
Analyst Daniel Ives said: “Our recent checks in the field shows an uptick in demand around enterprise software, cybersecurity, and a clear surge in demand around major AI projects and use cases exploding for 2024.”
He added: “Microsoft is humming on the AI front heading in 2024,” impressed by the monetization of its large-language AI chatbot Copilot, which is used on Bing Search.
“We believe the stock has yet to price in what we view as the next wave of cloud and AI growth coming in 2024 with a strong competitive cloud edge versus Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).”

With semiconductor units down 20% year-on-year in 2023, he noted that the worst unit correction in 22 years is almost through the inventory correction. 
While Danely expects more estimate cuts to the analog companies due to the auto and industrial correction (combined 30% of semi-TAM), the analyst noted these cuts are getting smaller, and should trough in the first half of fiscal 2024.
Danely is most positive on DRAM and reiterated Micron Technology, Inc (NASDAQ:MU) as his top pick, given his expected 50% year-on-year increase in DRAM pricing in 2024. 
Danely’s other Buy-rated names include Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), Microchip Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MCHP), AVGO, Analog Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:ADI), ON Semiconductor Corp (NASDAQ:ON), Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM), and GlobalFoundries Inc (NASDAQ:GFS).
Micron’s price target of $95 reflects DRAM upturn. AMD’s price target of $136 builds on PC recovery, server share gains and AI success. 
Broadcom’s price target of $1,100 took into account the company being an AI beneficiary, EPS accretion from VMWare. 
Microchip’s $100 price target builds upon bottoming of consensus EPS estimates. Qualcomm’s $160 price target attracted attention courtesy of wireless inventory replenishment and share gains at Samsung. 
Analog Devices’ price target of $210 gained attention as one of the most defensive name with bottoming consensus EPS estimates. On Semiconductor’s $85 price target reflected silicon carbide offsetting some of the downturn. GlobalFoundries’ $70 price target got a callout for restructuring initiatives offsetting semiconductor downturn.

What Happened: Amundi, with $2 trillion under management, anticipates a less robust economic growth in the upcoming year, which could result in a weaker performance from the leading mega-cap stocks, reported Business Insider on Saturday.
In a panel discussion at the New York Stock Exchange, Craig Sterling, the head of equity research at Amundi U.S., stated that the firm is underweight on U.S. stocks for 2024. He highlighted the significant difference between the current stock market and that of a year ago.
Despite the S&P 500’s impressive 25% surge in 2023, the “Magnificent Seven” stocks, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), were the primary drivers of this growth.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) are all set to report their quarterly results, and analysts anticipate that AI-focused companies will outperform expectations, potentially sustaining the equity market rally.
Despite this optimism, investors may exercise caution leading up to a two-day Federal Reserve meeting beginning on Tuesday. While economists expect the Fed to maintain the current high rate, traders will be attentive to signals regarding the trajectory of interest rates. Meanwhile, the Chinese market continues to experience volatility, driven by concerns about its troubled property sector.
Cues From Last Week’s Trading:
In the week ending on Jan. 26, major stock indices saw gains for a third consecutive week, buoyed by optimism surrounding the economy, inflation, and earnings. Key drivers included preliminary fourth-quarter GDP data highlighting the economy’s strength, varied earnings reports, and the December personal consumption expenditure index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure.
The S&P 500 Index reached record levels for four sessions during the week, concluding just below the record, while the Dow Industrials closed the week in record territory.

Equity and M&A experts believe that, after a year beset by volatile markets and rising interest rates, 2024 offers improving conditions for takeover deals and corporate mergers.
“Capital markets were not as open or freewheeling, and 2023 did not happen the way we thought it would,"" said Tom Miles, Head of Americas M&A at Morgan Stanley. 
“The market forces are in place that make an eventual return inevitable. It's not a question of if but when.”
One piece of the M&A jigsaw that was largely missing last year was private equity (PE) firms. These players use leveraged buyout methods to take poorly performing publicly traded companies private. The goal is to exit via an IPO or sell off the assets at a profit.
Pitchbook analyst Tim Clarke noted how higher interest rates made it more costly for PE firms to engage in deals.
“PE's share of M&A has no doubt been constrained by reduced access to leverage,” he said. During 2023, PE involvement was the lowest total recorded going back to 2005.
Overall volumes of M&A dropped to $2.4 trillion in 2023, down from $3.1 trillion in 2022 and $5.2 trillion at its 2021 peak.
But analysts at Morgan Stanley expect both corporate and PE deal-making to be stronger in 2024 after the fourth-quarter rally on equity markets in 2023.
“Corporate balance sheets are strong, financing markets are improving and CEO confidence, which is closely correlated with M&A activity, is climbing,” said Miles.
Which sectors, then, can investors expect to lead this increase in M&A activity. There’s agreement here on three sectors that appear ripe for takeovers to ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['News', 'M&A', 'Analyst Color', 'Equities', 'Large Cap', 'Broad U.S. Equity ETFs', 'Small Cap', 'Economics', 'Small Business', 'Markets', 'Analyst Ratings', 'Tech', 'ETFs', 'General']",0.99086,Positive,https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/36824293

What Happened: Wolfenbarger, a seasoned market observer, anticipates a severe drop in the U.S. stock market and a prolonged recession. Wolfenbarger, with over three decades of investing experience, relies on a variety of economic indicators that suggest an impending downturn, according to a Business Insider report Tuesday.
Wolfenbarger, the founder of Bull and Bear Profits and a former JPMorgan banker, is particularly concerned about the consistent decline of The Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index and the longest stretch of an inverted yield curve in more than half a century. His forecast is more severe than The Conference Board’s, which predicts a two-quarter recession.
“The depth of the latest yield curve inversion has only been matched or exceeded by those preceding the Great Depression and the major recessions of the mid-1970s and early 1980s,” said Wolfenbarger.

Cues From Monday's Trading:
U.S. stocks opened Monday’s session higher but exhibited caution in early trading before rallying strongly, particularly in the final hour. This strength emerged despite a lack of significant Main Street catalysts, as traders factored in expectations of a robust tech reporting season. Several tech companies, including the “Magnificent Seven,” are scheduled to report this week.
The Dow Industrials, S&P 500 Index, and Nasdaq 100 all closed at fresh records, while the Nasdaq Composite reached a new two-year high.
Small-cap stocks also joined the rally, with the Russell 2,000 Index surpassing the 2,000 level.
Most sectors, except for energy stocks, saw gains, with consumer discretionary, communication services, and IT stocks showing strong increases.

The team’s recent findings indicate a concerning concentration of market power in the hands of the top 10 stocks on the MSCI USA Index, reminiscent of the worrisome market conditions seen two decades ago.
As Bloomberg reported Tuesday, the combined share of the MSCI USA Index’s top 10 stocks, including the prominent ‘Magnificent Seven’ technology giants, has escalated to a significant 29.3% in December. This figure approaches the historical peak of 33.2% witnessed in June 2000, during the height of the dot-com bubble.
Diversity within these top ranks is also dwindling, with only four sectors represented, a stark contrast to the historical median of six. This lack of diversification heightens the vulnerability of the market to shocks in these sectors.

Earnings from the likes of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) have triggered negative reactions, with the former two reacting to softish guidance, while the latter came under pressure due to weakness in its bread-and-butter ad revenue.
Traders may also look to bide time to see off the Federal Reserve’s rate decision due  Wednesday.  Investors will likely turn their attention to the policy statement as they seek clues on the potential timing and scale of future rate cuts, said Comerica Chief Investment Officer John Lynch. A pause decision at the January meeting now appears to be a foregone conclusion.
Cues From Tuesday's Trading:
Stocks closed mixed on Tuesday as traders digested the earnings flow from before the market open and awaited key tech earnings reports due after the close. They also reacted to positive job market, housing and consumer confidence readings.
As traders pushed back their rate cut expectations following a string of positive Main Street data, financial stocks rallied, keeping the Dow Industrials in the green. The 30-stock blue-chip average ended at a fresh high on Tuesday. On the other hand, the S&P 500 retreated from a closing high hit on Monday, and the Nasdaq Composite also experienced weakness.
Among the S&P sector indices, communication services, IT, and real estate stocks retreated on Tuesday, while energy and financial stocks gained some ground.

What Happened: In the lead-up to the FOMC meeting — scheduled for 2:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday, Jan. 31 — the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 slipped 1.4%. This marked its worst session since early January.
Here’s a breakdown:

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is down 6%, due to disappointing results for the quarter ending in December.
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), a prominent player in the artificial intelligence space, also fell on softer-than-expected results.
The broader market, as measured by the S&P 500 index, fell 0.9%.
The pace of job growth slowed from 158,000 in December to 107,000 this month (below the expected 147,000), according to the ADP National Employment Report.
The CBOE Volatility Index, also known as the market fear gauge or VIX, rallied 8%. Bonds gained ground as investors adopted a more cautious approach. Treasury yields fell across all key maturities, with the 10-year yield falling below the 4% mark.

Announced on Tuesday, these funds use covered-call options strategies to generate capital gains and income from leading technology giants, including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).
The fund will be reallocated monthly to ensure an equal weighting of each of the seven YieldMax ETFs within the Fund’s holdings. The move would give accessibility and streamline ownership for shareholders, with indirect exposure to the Magnificent Seven through a single ETF.

Given the Federal Reserve’s data-dependent stance, a couple of manufacturing activity data and the routine jobless claims data due for the day could draw traders’ attention.
Cues From Wednesday's Trading:
U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday, stung by the double-whammy of earnings disappointments and a hawkish Fed. Traders reacted negatively to earnings from Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), all of which have significant weightings in the S&P 500 Index.
The major indices started the session lower and moved roughly sideways until the Fed decision. The Dow was seen moving in and out of the unchanged line as it received support from a strong upward move in Boeing Co.’s (NYSE:BA) shares. The Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 indices languished in negative territory.
Following the rate decision, the indices either moved above the flat line or trimmed their losses. Jerome Powell disappointed traders by offering no clear signal toward a rate-cut schedule, so they dumped stocks in late afternoon trading.
The S&P 500 Index pulled further away from its record close, with the broader gauge and the Nasdaq Composite settling at the lowest levels in about two weeks. 
The market witnessed a broad-based sell-off, with communications stocks being the worst hit. IT, consumer discretionary, and energy stocks also saw marked weakness.

Stock Market Direction
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows the stock market has pulled back on Powell’s remarks.
The chart shows the stock market is near the top band of the support zone.
The chart shows that in the early trade, the dip in the stock market is being bought.
The FOMC rate decision came as expected yesterday. However, Powell trampled on the speculation of a rate cut in March. Please read yesterday’s Afternoon Capsule for details.
Fed Chair Powell said labor availability is a big factor in the Fed’s decision.
Previously, the Fed was trying to drive unemployment higher. The reason was in traditional economics, higher unemployment brings down inflation.
This cycle has defied traditional economics thus far. Inflation is coming down while unemployment remains very low.
In The Arora Report analysis of Powell’s press conference, the Fed is not worried about inflation running back up. However, the Fed is concerned about inflation being sticky and staying above their target. If the employment picture stays strong, it will be difficult for the Fed to cut interest rates as the Fed does not want inflation to get stuck above their target. This is the reason prudent investors are paying very close attention to the jobs report.
The jobs report, known as the mother of all reports, will be released tomorrow at 8:30am ET.
In The Arora Report analysis, the jobs report tomorrow is the key to the near-term direction of the stock market. If the jobs report is strong, the stock market will likely tumble. If the jobs report is weak, the stock market will likely run up. 
Weekly initial jobless claims came at 224K vs. 215K consensus. This indicates that the jobs picture is still very strong, but the data is beginning to weaken.
Q4 Productivity-Prel came at 3.2% vs. 2.1% consensus.

Blowout Jobs Report And Earnings
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows a rally after a shallow pullback.
The chart shows that the shallow pullback approached but did not penetrate the high band of the support zone. From a technical perspective this is a positive.
The chart shows an attempt of a new breakout. This new breakout would have likely followed through if it was not for the jobs report data upsetting bulls’ hopium this morning.
The jobs report is a blowout. Here are the details:

Non-farm payrolls came at 353K vs. 175K consensus.
Non-farm private payrolls came at 317K vs. 150K consensus.
Unemployment rate came at 3.7% vs. 3.8% consensus.
Average work week came at 34.1 vs. 34.4 consensus.


This is the strongest jobs report since January 2023.
In The Arora Report analysis, this jobs report is simply too strong for the Fed to cut rates. Even though Powell was clear that a rate cut in March was not the base case, stock market bulls have continued to buy stocks on hopes of a rate cut in March.  
In The Arora Report analysis, this jobs report significantly upsets stock market bulls’ hopium. If it was not for the blowout earnings from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META), the stock market would have likely fallen by as much as 1000 DJIA points on this report.  Now the questions for prudent investors are the following:
In view of blowout earnings from AMZN and META, will the momo crowd even care about the jobs report?

Will the new narrative of momo gurus that interest rates no longer matter ring true with investors?  
Layoffs helped AMZN and META report blowout earnings. If the premarket gains hold, META and AMZN have added about $275B in market cap since they reported earnings after the close yesterday.

The chip designer will report its quarterly earnings after closing on February 21. 
The analyst will seek for a notable but more measured 3% – 5% or $0.5 billion – $1 billion upside to both the reported fourth quarter (consensus $20 billion) and guided first quarter (consensus $21.4 billion) mainly due to incremental supply gains offset by China restrictions and some transition effects before the B100 accelerator launch planned for the second half of 2024.

Stepping above quarterly EPS noise, Arya will focus on Nvidia’s flagship GPU Tech Conference (GTC) planned for March 18 – March 20, where the company will likely showcase its pipeline and perhaps update the prior $250 billion annual AI accelerator TAM forecast.

The elite cluster includes Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (NYSE:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). The group saw its combined worth surpass the total economic output of global cities such as New York, Tokyo, London, Los Angeles, London, Paris, Seoul, Chicago, San Francisco, Osaka and Shanghai, as highlighted by Michael Hartnett, Bank of America’s chief market strategist, in a recent note.
The stocks are now testing the “law of physics,” Bloomberg columnists John Authers and Isabelle Lee wrote on Monday. Ed Yardeni, a popular Wall Street industry veteran, said “the Mag-7 once again are sucking all the air out of the universe,” in a recent note addressing the spectacular jump of Meta Platforms.
Last Friday, the social media giant owned by Mark Zuckerberg made a historic $204-billion market value jump in a single day, the largest for any U.S. company ever.

What Happened: Data, provided by Nasdaq eVestment showed that among the worst-performing strategies was the equity long-short fund — where hedge fund managers buy stocks they think will perform well and bet against stocks they believe are likely to fall.
Indeed, investors have pulled more than $150 billion from this type of fund over the past five years as they have underperformed the market in nine of the past 10 years.
The equity long-short fund has been around for decades and was generally successful during periods of broadly calm market conditions as so-called “star stock pickers” were able to capitalize strongly on market fluctuations by buying long and selling short.
When more turbulent conditions persist, it becomes much more difficult for stock pickers to predict. One of the chief problems for pickers last year, however, was the expectation that several mega-cap stocks had become so overvalued that they had become ripe for shorting.

What Happened: Brian Belski, the chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, believes that the current market risk due to the dominance of mega-cap tech stocks is being overestimated. He stated in a note on Tuesday that the risk is not as severe as some might think, reported Business Insider.
The “Magnificent 7” mega-cap tech stocks, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), currently account for 29% of the S&P 500.
Although a potential decline in demand for these stocks poses a risk, Belski is confident that the broader market can still yield positive returns even if the mega-cap tech stocks falter.
“Our work shows that the stock market has held up just fine in prior periods when the outperformance of mega-cap stocks started to wane,” Belski said.

Here’s a look at how much return an investment in a basket comprising the Magnificent seven stocks in equal proportion would have fetched vis-a-vis Cathie Wood-led Ark Investment’s flagship Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK).
New Group On The Block: FAANG was the precursor to the group, now collectively called the Magnificent Seven. Originally named FANG by Jim Cramer in 2013, the group became known as FAANG with the addition of Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in 2017. The original members were Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), which then went by the name Facebook, Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), formerly Google.
Later iterations were MAGA, which included Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) along with Apple, Alphabet and Amazon, and MAMAA, comprising Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon.
The phrase Magnificent Seven was first used by BofA Securities analyst Michael Hartnett in 2023. The constituent companies spearheaded the stock market rebound during the year, thanks to the dominant market positioning, innovativeness, brand appeal and financial muscle of these companies. This group comprises the biggest mega-cap techs including Meta, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).

S&P 500 At 5000
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that S&P 500 is comfortably above the top band of the support zone.  
The chart shows that the move up is on lower volume. This is a negative. 
Historically, when S&P 500 hits the next 1000 benchmark, the median return is as follows:

0.57% after one week
2.00% after one month
3.5% after three months
7.73% after six months


The above data is only history, and no one should depend on it. It is more important to understand how various groups behave.  

Sentiment moves higher in the extreme zone.
Momo crowd buying becomes even more aggressive.
Mom and pop who are normally not active in the stock market jump in.
Bears throw in the towel and jump in.
Underperforming money managers become aggressive buyers.
Smart money takes advantage of the strength and trims positions. 


“Buy low and sell high” is a simple concept in theory. This is exactly what you need to do to consistently beat the stock market. However, in practice it is not as easy as it sounds for the following reasons:

Human emotions of fear and greed.
Market mechanics
Market controlled by momo crowd
Momo gurus
Short squeezes
Thousands of constantly changing variables from across the globe


The key is to look at returns, not only in terms of absolute returns, but in terms of risk adjusted returns.
As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in the protection band, which strikes the optimum balance between various crosscurrents. Please scroll down to see the protection band. 

Jobless Claims
Initial Jobless Claims came at 218K vs. 218K consensus. This indicates that the jobs picture is staying strong.  Initial Jobless Claims is a leading indicator and carries heavy weight in our adaptive ZYX Asset Allocation Model with inputs in ten categories.  In plain English, adaptiveness means that the model changes itself with market conditions. Most models on Wall Street are static. They work for a while and then stop working when market conditions change.
Treasury Auction
Yesterday, we shared with you that the largest ever 10-year Treasury auction was still. Please read the Afternoon Capsule for details. 
Today, there is a $25B 30-year auction. This is not the largest auction. The largest auction was $27B.

“Expectations for strong macro and no recession keep investors in the soft landing camp at 65%, with hard landing probability fading to just 11%,” said lead analyst Michael Hartnett, noting also that those managers now expecting “no landing,” or continued growth trajectory, rose to 19% in February, up from 7% in January.

Hotter Inflation
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows a slight pullback on inflation data.
The chart shows volume continues to be low, indicating lack of conviction.
The volume today will be a tell. If the stock market pulls back on heavy volume on bad inflation data, that will be an indication that the bulls are losing control. On the other hand, if the stock market has only a shallow pullback or goes up on lower volume, that will be an indication that bulls continue to be in control.
CPI was worse than expected. Here are the details:

Headline CPI came at 0.3% month-over-month vs. 0.2% consensus.
Core CPI came at 0.4% month-over-month vs. 0.3% consensus.


In yesterday’s Morning Capsule, we shared with you:

Momo gurus are already being proactive to prevent a selloff if the data shows that inflation is not coming down. The new mantra of momo gurus is that stocks will go up even if inflation does not come down. Keep in mind that momo gurus’ real job is to run up the stock market under the disguise of analysis.


Momo gurus are extremely clever. Realizing that their new narrative was not that good, now they have come up with a more persuasive narrative to persuade their followers to buy stocks. The new narrative is that this rise in inflation is a one-off.
The CPI data today shows that Powell’s fear of Burns’ blunder is justified. Arthur Burns was the most intelligent Fed Chairman. He lowered rates when inflation came down but was forced to raise rates again when inflation picked up again. This is known as Burns’ blunder.
New earnings are having an impact on the stock market.

Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE: UBER).
Note the following:

The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of UBER stock is being used to illustrate the point.
The chart shows the jump up in UBER stock on the news of the buy back.
The chart shows the Arora buy zone and the power of buy zones. The example from UBER on the chart represents a profit 208%.

Hartnett’s insights reveal that while every bubble is unique, they share common catalysts such as technological innovation, new markets and, notably, central bank easing. These elements have historically converged to inflate asset prices beyond sustainable levels.
The AI bubble, for example, was ignited by the Federal Reserve’s response to Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse and the subsequent rise of ChatGPT. This scenario mirrors past bubbles such as the Plaza Accord’s effect on Japan and the internet bubble fueled by the Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) crisis. 
Similarly, policy stimuli in response to the COVID-19 pandemic inflated crypto and tech stocks, reminiscent of the Mississippi and South Sea Company bubbles sparked by changes to English usury laws in 1714.

The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of AMAT stock is being used to illustrate the point.
As we have been sharing with you, Applied Materials is the best “picks and shovels” play in artificial intelligence.
Artificial intelligence needs more sophisticated chips. To manufacture more sophisticated chips, companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE: TSM) and Intel Corp (NASDAQ: INTC) are buying more sophisticated equipment to manufacture the chips. Applied Materials is a big beneficiary.
The chart shows the big jump in AMAT stock on earnings.
RSI on the chart shows that AMAT is overbought.
The power of the demand for AI is reflected in the following earnings details from AMAT:

The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.13 vs. $1.90 consensus.
The company reported revenue of $6.71B vs. $6.48B consensus.
The company is forecasting revenue for the current quarter with a midpoint of $6.5B vs. $6.34B consensus.


The strength in AMAT is pushing tech stocks higher, especially AI stocks.
The rise in AMAT stock shows that “picks and shovels” is a great strategy.

Analysts offered their take on the upcoming results.
Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson maintained Nvidia with an Outperform and raised the price target from $600 to $800.
The analyst noted that Nvidia will surpass estimates again and raise future guidance. During his mid-December travels in Asia, component suppliers and Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs) indicated strong quarter trends. 
They predicted further growth in the first quarter, with potential concerns about Cloud Service Providers (CSP) growth slowing in late 2024.

However, recent earnings reports from CSPs show continued momentum in AI infrastructure spending, with many large data center operators planning to increase capital expenditure in 2024, primarily for AI investments.
Bryson’s recent discussions with memory vendors revealed a continued high demand for High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), with Nvidia expected to be the largest consumer of these components in 2024. 
The fourth quarter also saw significant capital raises for AI startups, which will likely benefit AI infrastructure providers either through direct purchases of AI systems or by renting AI infrastructure.

Tepid Consumer
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT).
Note the following:

The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of WMT stock is being used to illustrate the point.
The U.S. economy is 70% consumer based, and Walmart is the largest retailer in the U.S. Therefore, investors should pay close attention to Walmart.
The chart shows the stock is going higher as of this writing.
The chart shows when Walmart reported earnings. Walmart beat earnings estimates for the last quarter. Here are the details:

Q4 revenue came at $173.4B vs. $158.4B consensus.
Walmart hit $100B in e-commerce sales.
Q1 adjusted EPS came at $1.48-$1.56 vs. $1.48 consensus.
Dividend increased by 9%.


The stock market has held up, in part, due to excess consumer spending.
Stock market bulls are counting on excess consumer spending continuing.
Walmart earnings are painting a tepid picture of the consumer. Walmart says shoppers are staying “choiceful.” The data from Walmart runs counter to stock market bulls’ hopium of the consumer continuing to spend excessively.
Walmart stock is running up, in part, because Walmart is buying Vizio Holding Corp (NYSE: VZIO) to expand advertising. VZIO is in the ZYX Buy portfolio that surrounds the Model Portfolio, and VZIO is the 191st Arora Portfolio company to be bought out.

The Seattle-based e-commerce giant is replacing pharmacy company Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA). In recent years, Walgreens has seen its shares plummet 28.4% in 2022; 30.1% in 2023; and 14.6% in 2024.
Amazon stock tumbled 51% in 2022 but came roaring back more than 100% since the beginning of 2023. Now it’s on deck to join DJIA — the so-called “venerable index.”
As one of Wall Street’s oldest stock indicators, the DJIA doesn’t get shaken up often. The last member to join was Walgreens in 2018 when it replaced  General Electric, which enjoyed a 111-year tenure. Still, membership carries a certain prestige. Or does it?
“I remember when this would have mattered,” Scott Nations, founder of Nations Indexes, said on social media following the announcement.

The Magnificent Seven accounts for a record 13% of the aggregate hedge fund long portfolios. Yet, it remains significantly underweighted compared to a 26% collective stake in the Russell 3000 — underscoring a cautious approach towards mega-cap equities.

Microsoft is leading the pack in artificial intelligence after its early investment in OpenAI. The creator of ChatGPT, whose name is synonymous with the technology itself, is by far the most successful player in generative AI. In fact, ChatGPT holds the title of the most quickly adopted technology in history, reaching 100 million active users within just two months of its public launch.
Microsoft began its relationship with the generative AI pioneer in 2019 with a cool $1 billion. The move drew relatively little attention at the time – the startup market was red hot and AI had yet to come into its own – but five years on, the investment has proven to be a game changer.

As a provider of key technology needed to develop artificial intelligence (AI) platforms, the company is strategically positioned to benefit from the ongoing AI craze. 
Jensen Huang, Nvidia's co-founder and chief executive, said during the late Wednesday call that ""a whole new industry is being formed, and that's driving our growth."" 
Investors took these words seriously, taking much of the tech sector up.
While big tech companies like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) compete to find the next groundbreaking stage in AI, companies that provide the infrastructure for those developments are the beneficiaries.
With quarterly revenues of $22.10 billion representing an increase of 265% year-over-year, Nvidia's growth was fueled by rising sales of AI infrastructure such as the H200 chip.
Analysts looking at Nvidia's performance overwhelmingly made mention of the growing market for generative AI as a motor behind the company's recent success, with several analysts raising the company's price target.
Nvidia's success in AI is pushing it close to the 2 trillion market cap, making it the third largest company by that measure. The company's $240 billion jump in market capitalization on Thursday accounts as the largest single-day jump in market history.

What Happened: Al-Rumayyan made this announcement at an investment event in Miami, sponsored by the sovereign wealth fund, reported Reuters on Thursday. He highlighted the kingdom’s energy resources and funding capabilities as key factors contributing to this potential.
“We are fairly well positioned to be an AI hub outside of the U.S.,” he said.
“AI will consume a lot of energy and we are the global leader when it comes to fossil fuel energy and when it comes to renewable energy.” 
He also emphasized that Saudi Arabia, being the world’s largest oil producer, has the “political will” and financial resources to drive AI projects.
Al-Rumayyan’s remarks suggest that data centers could be a crucial element of Riyadh’s strategy to leverage the surging demand for generative AI technology, which demands substantial processing power.

Boom/Bust: Nvidia’s “quarter/guidance for the ages” delivered this week should not unduly worry investors, according to analyst Daniel Ives. For those doubters, the analyst has a definitive response. “Our answer is firm and confident: this is a 1995 Moment as now the AI Revolution and $1 trillion of incremental spending over the next decade is hitting the software ecosystem and rest of tech sector,” he said.
“Nvidia and the golden GPUs are the start of the spending wave…not the end.” 
The AI revolution will only intensify further, as a myriad of use cases are built out across the enterprise and consumer ecosystem, Ives said, adding that this is a “transformational tech trend” not seen since the start of the Internet in the mid 1990s.

Biotech Breakout
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (ARCA: XBI).
Note the following:

The chart shows biotech has broken out.
The chart shows the move up was on high volume, indicating conviction in the move.
The chart shows when XBI was in the Arora buy zone. This represents a 54% gain in about four months. XBI is in the ZYX Allocation Core Model Portfolio by The Arora Report.
RSI on the chart shows that biotech is overbought.
The breakout in biotech shows there are opportunities for investors beyond AI, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA), and big tech.
Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE: LLY) is a prime example. LLY has gained 139% in about a year.
In important news for AI, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) has canceled its electric vehicle project.  About 2,000 people have been working on this project. Apple seems to be recognizing that it needs to devote more resources to AI. This is good news for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA).
Just released GDP data shows the economy is very strong and there is inflation pressure. Here are the details:

Q4 GDP Second Estimate came at 3.2% vs. 3.2% consensus.
GDP Deflator Second Estimate came at 1.6% vs. 1.5% consensus.


Prudent investors should keep in mind that GDP is a lagging indicator. The Arora Report system is based on leading indicators in ten categories. Please click here to see the ten categories of the ZYX Asset Allocation Model.
The latest consumer confidence data indicates that there is a high probability of this stock market rally stalling and even pulling back. Consumer confidence came at 106.7 vs. 114.6  consensus.

Inflation Gauge
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market has failed to make progress since the release of hotter CPI.
The chart shows that the stock market was pulling back before the release of PCE, but improved on release of PCE.
The stock market has been anxiously awaiting PCE. PCE is the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge. PCE rose the most in a year. Here are the details:

Headline PCE came at 0.3% vs. 0.4% consensus.
Core PCE came at 0.4% vs. 0.4% consensus.


In The Arora Report analysis, the stock market improved on the release of the PCE data as there was fear of an even worse number.
Digging into the data that underlies PCE, in The Arora Report analysis, there is deflation in goods, but there is serious inflation in services. Deflation in goods is coming from China.
The release of PCE data has triggered aggressive buying in AI stocks and bitcoin. The buying is especially aggressive in C3.ai Inc (NYSE: AI) after the release of PCE data. C3.ai released better than expected earnings after the close yesterday. As a full disclosure, a signal was given in The Arora Report's ZYX Buy Change Alert.
The release of PCE data is also leading to very aggressive buying in small caps. As a full disclosure, iShares Russell 2000 ETF (ARCA: IWM) and its buy zone are in The Arora Report's ZYX Allocation Core Model Portfolio.
Personal income and spending data was also released this morning. Here are the details:

Personal spending came at 0.2% vs. 0.2% consensus.
Personal income came at 1.0% vs. 0.5% consensus.


Weekly initial claims came at 215K vs. 206K consensus. This indicates that the jobs picture remains strong, especially at the low end. However, the jobs picture is getting weaker in IT as many jobs are being replaced by AI.
Yesterday, the Fed’s Williams, Collins, and Bostic said that the Fed will continue to be date dependent. Bostic ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['Economics', 'Markets', 'General']",0.87206,Negative,https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/37399462

The results came amid an exciting earnings season. Here are some key analyst takeaways from the release.
Canaccord Genuity On Okta
Analyst T. Michael Walkley maintained a Hold rating while raising the price target from $85 to $95.
Although Okta reported strong fourth-quarter results that came in ahead of expectations, its first-quarter guidance showed decelerating cRPO (current remaining performance obligations) growth of 13%, Walkley said in a note.
Management only modestly raised the fiscal 2025 revenue growth outlook from 10% to 10-11%, he noted.
“We still view Okta as a long-term beneficiary of Zero Trust adoption given its positioning as a next-gen leader and consolidator in a large $80B TAM for Identity Security,” the analyst further stated.
Truist Securities On Okta
Analyst Joel P. Fishbein Jr. reiterated a Hold rating while lifting the price target from $85 to $105.
Okta reported strong fourth-quarter results and revised its topline and profit guidance higher for fiscal 2025, Fishbein said.
“The company is seeing strength with large customers and is seeing success with uplift from its OIG and PAM solutions in Workforce Identity,” the analyst wrote. “OKTA is making progress in its GTM organization with a shift in strategy to accelerate new logo growth,” he added.
Mizuho Securities On Okta
Analyst Gregg Moskowitz reaffirmed a Neutral rating while raising the price target from $90 to $105.
“OKTA reported a clearly better than expected F4Q, led by cRPO growth of 16% Y/Y and revenue growth of 19% Y/Y vs. our and the Street's 15% forecast,” Moskowitz wrote ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['News', 'Analyst Color', 'Earnings', 'Price Target', 'Reiteration', 'Analyst Ratings', 'Movers', 'Tech', 'Trading Ideas']",1.0,Positive,https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/37396696

This is evident by the price appreciation seen in ETFs tracking it — the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY), the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO) and the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV).

The fund has consistently outperformed, landing in the top echelons of its category over the past five years, including a notable finish in the top 14% for 2023, as per Morningstar.
Meyers' diverse investment strategy spans small to large caps. Yet, he currently sees the most potential in small-cap stocks, citing their significant upside compared to their larger counterparts, reported Business Insider.
The backdrop of U.S. stocks reaching all-time highs masks the nuanced reality of the market, Meyers told the publication. While indices like the S&P 500 have surged, the performance of many individual stocks remains lackluster.

His choices are Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
What Happened: Niles believes that the earnings potential of these companies will drive their stock performance in 2024, reported CNBC on Sunday. Niles pointed out that the recent surge in stock prices for big tech firms was not due to their earnings but rather the Federal Reserve’s policies.
He anticipates a shift this year, where earnings will play a more significant role in stock market performance. Despite negative estimate revisions for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Niles’ four picks continue to see analysts raise forecasts.
Analysts have raised EPS expectations for the four stocks by an average of 50% since the end of last year. In contrast, estimates have remained nearly flat for Google, Tesla, and Apple. This trend has resulted in substantial stock price increases for Nvidia, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon.

(NASDAQ:META).
He also believes Apple's AI play can move the earnings needle for Cupertino in double-digit percentages.
What Happened: Munster expressed optimism about Apple's AI play, stating that the company's first AI model is expected to be announced sometime in June.
However, investors in 2024 so far have not been very optimistic about Apple's prospects like analysts have.

However, Apple stock itself has not performed as well as it should have if AI is indeed a potential revenue maker for the company.
In fact, the Nasdaq Composite has beaten the Apple stock as far as performance in 2024 so far is concerned.
