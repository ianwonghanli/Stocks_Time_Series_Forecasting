That is up from a little more than half in the fall. Their picks range from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) to Zoom Video Communications Inc (NYSE: ZM).

And that’s not even counting the potential for policy headlines from Washington, which played a big role in trading last week.
This morning, trading seems pretty subdued ahead of the big week. That’s probably to be expected as Wall Street tends to look to earnings for a snapshot of the recent past and guidance for future performance. About a third of S&P 500 Index (SPX) companies are set to open their books this week.
Investors probably want to hear more about Biden’s potential capital gains tax hike on high earners, news of which contributed to last week’s price volatility.
There’s good news on the vaccine front as the Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) jab is back in distribution in many U.S. states after health officials lifted an 11-day pause on use of the vaccine amid worries about blood clotting as a rare side effect. 
With so much to consider this week, you might want to keep an eye on Wall Street’s main measure of investor jitters, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX). The index is up this morning, but it’s hanging out at just under 18. A number below 20 in this market appears to mean alarm bells aren’t really much of an issue. But there could be plenty of room for surprises this week amid so many earnings reports, a Fed meeting, and lots of economic reports.
The Week Ahead In Economic Data
This morning, we saw durable goods orders for March come in softer than expected—up 0.5% against a Briefing.com consensus forecast of a 2.0% gain. The numbers come after durable goods orders in February unexpectedly fell after a string of gains. A month ago, some economy-watchers suggested the soft February number could have been an anomaly—a nonlinear data point within an uptrend. This month’s tepid number might call into question the pace of the current recovery. Still, it was a positive number, and considering how atypical this pandemic period has been, the recovery is likely to be atypical as well.  
Tomorrow, the market is scheduled to get two February price indices for the housing market and a consumer confidence number for April from the Conference Board. Last time around, the index for March showed consumer confidence at its highest point in a year amid recovery expectations. With the vaccine rollout progressing well, in the United States at least, it could be interesting to see whether the numbers show another jump.

After the bell, the California-based EV pioneer and clean energy company Tesla is expected to report its first-quarter earnings of $0.79 per share. Elon Musk is also expected to give special attention to its Autopilot, its suite of advanced driver-assistance systems, which has been again criticized for lulling some drivers into a false sense of security and implying self-driving abilities well beyond its existing capabilities.

Tough Act To Follow For iPhone Maker In Fiscal Q2,JJ Kinahan,2021-04-26T21:26:49Z,https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/21/04/20802335/can-apples-earnings-impress-again-tough-act-to-follow-for-iphone-maker-in-fiscal-q2,"['AAPL', 'MS', 'WFC']",https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/og_image_social_share_1200x630/images/story/2012/office-1730939_1920_0.jpg,"There’s so much news swirling around Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) that digging into the fundamentals seems like a monumental task. We’ll do it anyway as investors await earnings from the biggest company (in market cap) on earth.
The iPhone maker’s earnings report after the close Wednesday will come right after it unveiled a bunch of new products just a week ago, and following a solid fiscal Q1 for the iPhone maker. 
If you’re keeping score, AAPL has a hard act to follow. In its fiscal Q1, it surpassed analysts’ estimates in almost every key category, whether it was iPhone sales, services, iPads, Macs, or wearables. Greater China sales rose 57%. Can AAPL hit it out of the park again? That’s what investors are wondering.
Going into earnings, consider keeping an eye on Services revenues—the category that includes cloud storage and backup, digital content and payment services. It’s grown so quickly that it’s elbowed its way up to the No. 2 business category spot for the company. The question is whether Services can keep up the strong traction it’s developed over the last few quarters.
Mac and iPad sales, too, might be a couple to keep tabs on, as many analysts have pointed out how the pandemic seemed to infuse new life into the lowly personal computer. AAPL’s rollout of new products last week (see more below) could be a harbinger of what’s ahead.
On the subject of “what’s ahead,” it’s something investors have had to basically guess the last few quarters. AAPL hasn’t offered guidance since the pandemic began. Will that change now that vaccinations are making progress? We’ll have to wait and see.
iPhone Impressed Last Time, But Keep An Eye On Supply Chain
One thing that could be tough for AAPL this time around is exceeding iPhone expectations. It’s not too long since people were talking about the iPhone being a smaller and smaller share of AAPL’s total revenue. Then AAPL sold a record-breaking $65.6 billion worth of iPhones in fiscal Q1, a 17% year-over-year rise. Those results were helped by the introduction of new 5G models last fall.
AAPL faced some supply chain issues in fiscal Q2, and investors should also listen for any updates on those. However, it doesn’t look like anything AAPL couldn’t handle, according to Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani.
Barron’s quoted Daryanani saying that AAPL is “well-positioned to report upside to March quarter estimates,” driven by strong performance by both iPhone and services, and despite ongoing component shortages.
“While the supply chain issues are real, we expect Apple will be relatively protected by its status as one of the largest electronics purchasers in the world,” the analyst wrote in a recent report. He points out that Foxconn, a key Apple manufacturing partner, has called out the tight supply of parts but said it would affect less than 10% of customer orders.
He notes that Apple had guided to some deceleration in services in the quarter after 30% growth in the December quarter, but he sees potential that the growth will be steady or better given strength in the App Store.

Again. 
It’s only been six weeks since the last Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, but they’re gathering again today. The usual press conference featuring Fed Chairman Jerome Powell comes right after the meeting ends at 2 p.m. ET tomorrow, and analysts don’t expect any change in policy. 
Trading might be a little slow ahead of all this, which is kind of typical when investors await the latest from Powell and company. Major indices didn’t move much in the overnight session. That being said, the Fed may be about the third-most important event this week after gross domestic product (GDP) and Tech earnings. 
Looking ahead to this afternoon, Tech takes center stage with earnings from Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). More on all that farther down. 
This earnings season is now about one-third finished, and 84% of companies have beaten Wall Street’s consensus earnings estimates, according to FactSet. That’s well above the average level of positive surprises, which indicates analysts may have been too conservative heading in. General Electric (NYSE: GE) did very well but the stock’s down a bit, and Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) also reports later on, which could be interesting. 
Fed Ahead As Investors Await Views On Latest Strong Data
Unlike last month, we don’t get a “dot-plot” of Fed officials’ outlooks for rates this time around. For that, we have to wait until the mid-June FOMC meeting. But Powell might be asked to comment on recent booming economic data and higher than expected inflation readings. 
The Fed puts return to a healthy jobs picture high on its list, and the last two initial jobless claims reports and March payrolls both suggested progress. It could be interesting to get Powell’s thoughts on these numbers and what they might mean going forward. 
That said, it would be very surprising to hear Powell say anything about getting more hawkish anytime soon. The Fed’s feet seem firmly planted in the dovish camp, and Fed funds futures suggest no change in rate policy this year. It’s likely Powell wants to see a few more solid jobs reports—including May payrolls—before making any new pronouncements about the employment picture. 
It’s kind of unfortunate timing that the Fed meeting concludes Wednesday—a day before Powell and the rest of us get a first look at the government’s estimate for Q1 gross domestic product (GDP) growth (see more below). Thursday also brings the weekly initial jobless claims data. 
After two solid weeks in a row, it would be good to see more improvement. However, anything under 600,000 would extend the streak of reports below that level. It’s still high, but a major improvement after months of 700,000 to 800,000 new claims a week. Before Covid, the average was well below 300,000, but it’s unclear when we’ll get back to those kinds of levels.

Well, these days everyone probably would complain about inflation if it ever reappeared in a major way, but the Fed promises it won’t do anything about it until employment is on track toward whatever “normal” was before the pandemic. 
As Wall Street analysts expected, the Fed didn’t change rates or make any other policy changes coming out of this week’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting that ended this afternoon. Rates stayed near zero, where they’ve been for over a year, and the Fed remains committed to its $120 billion a month bond-buying program designed to keep borrowing costs low and refuel the economy coming out of the pandemic. 
At first blush, this looks like a pretty dovish meeting, and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell made clear the Fed isn’t talking about any decline in asset purchases or increase in rates. There were three things investors were curious about going in—asset purchases, rates, and inflation—and Powell was dovish on all of them. 
Treasury yields actually began to fall as the Powell press conference went on this afternoon, with the 10-year yield edging down toward 1.61% to 1.62%. That’s down a few basis points from this morning’s two-week highs. 
There was no change to the Fed’s commitment, outlined last month, to basically stand on the sidelines “for some time” if year-over-year inflation stays “moderately” above what has been the Fed’s long-term goal of 2%. Core inflation, per the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) prices report, was 1.4% in February, the most recent month tracked. However, consumer prices are already rising more than 2% on a year-over-year basis. 
Optimism Club: Fed Sees Positive Signs For Economy
There were a couple of changes in the Fed’s statement from last time, with the Fed now saying employment has “strengthened.” Arguably, you could see that as an improvement from “turned up” in its March statement. The statement noted some inflation, but again said it’s likely to be “transitory.” March consumer prices rose 2.6%, the highest year-over-increase since August 2018. 
In another change, the Fed’s statement now says sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak, but have “shown improvement.” The public health crisis still weighs on the economy, the Fed said, but no longer on employment or inflation. 
Still, inflation doesn’t seem to be a really big concern now for the Fed, judging from how the statement and press conference went. They seem basically comfortable with inflation staying above 2% for the rest of the year because that will be against very easy comparisons to a year ago, when we had the big slowdown due to Covid. The Fed apparently believes we’ll have to wait until next year to get a reliable sense of what inflation is doing 
The stock market had been mixed earlier Wednesday and stayed that way after the Fed’s decision and as investors waited for Powell to start his press conference. The S&P 500 Index (SPX) actually made up some ground and turned green after the statement. Earnings continue to be solid but the SPX hadn’t really gone anywhere since earnings season started, possibly an indication that a lot of the strength in earnings was already built in. 
Basically, this meeting looks like a placeholder. That means attention could focus more on the big earnings reports from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) coming up later today, along with the gross domestic product (GDP) report and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) earnings due tomorrow.

In light of the momentous occasion, Benzinga spoke with MindMed co-founder and CEO J.R. Rahn, as well as board member Kevin O’Leary, author, investor, ""Shark Tank"" star and co-founder of O'Shares ETFs.
What To Know: Mental health doesn’t discriminate. That’s become apparent given the pandemic which devastated the economy and left millions unemployed. With traditional mental health care infrastructures in the U.S. being outdated, demand for new, alternative solutions — those without acute adverse effects such as abuse and dependence — has picked up.
MindMed, which is focused on the medicinal value of psychedelics, is believed to have the answer by many, including Kevin O’Leary who backed the company in its early stages.
“I’ve been involved with the company for almost three years,” O’Leary explained. “When I first heard of this idea from J.R., I thought he was nuts. But, he convinced me and he has been 100% right in every milestone of the journey.”
Dubbed the ""Tesla of mental health,"" MindMed, through proprietary research, some of which was conducted in collaboration with the laboratory of Professor Dr. Matthias Liechti, the world’s leading psychedelics, pharmacology and clinical research group at University Hospital Basel, in Switzerland, has helped destigmatize and deploy psychedelics solutions.
In a move to bolster innovation and allow investors a chance to participate in the new age of medicine, MindMed listed on the Nasdaq, a brand that’s supported firms like Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['Penny Stocks', 'Cannabis', 'Top Stories', 'Exclusives', 'Markets', 'Interview']",0.90805,Neutral,https://amp.benzinga.com/amp/content/20871913

They’re under pressure early despite Amazon’s (NASDAQ: AMZN) impressive earnings yesterday, with signs of a bit of slowness in China’s economy dragging things lower. 
China’s services sector slowed this month, data showed, and manufacturing remains barely in expansionary mode. We still have weakness out of Europe, and China was expected to be coming along. Now that there’s a little weakening in China, that’s something rattling the markets a little bit. Another thing troubling some investors is the fact that more fiscal stimulus is coming in when many economists aren’t really sure it’s needed, which drives concerns about inflation. 
Speaking of which, core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) prices came in at 0.4% for March, a little higher than analysts had expected and higher than the previous reading of 0.1%. Markets are worried that we really haven’t gotten to the full impact of recovery and how that surge in demand is going to affect prices. There’s still lots of recovery to go and PCE prices are already up 2.3% year over year. The market’s a little concerned because companies are reporting supply shortages as it is and we aren’t even in full reopening status. 
April On Pace For Firm Wall Street Gain As Earnings Roll On
There’s still a lot of earnings ahead, and next week brings the April payrolls report. But for headline excitement, no week in the quarter can match the one we just had. Four of the five “FAANG” companies reported, the Fed held its meeting, and investors got a first look at Q1 gross domestic product.
The S&P 500 Index (SPX) set a new record high yesterday, but it looks like some profit-taking might be in the mix this morning. That’s not too surprising considering this is the last day of the month and the SPX is up 6% so far in April. 
After stumbling in January, the SPX is on pace for its third straight month of gains, up about 12.1% year-to-date. More than 80% of S&P 500 companies reporting so far have beaten Wall Street’s consensus earnings estimates, and generally they’ve painted optimistic pictures about the coming months as the economy reopens. That said, the market hasn’t really found a lot of traction since earnings season began, hinting that it could be at levels where buyers are becoming a bit scarce.
Energy comes into focus today with earnings from a couple big players, Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX). They report as the price of gasoline approaches $3 a gallon across the U.S., up more than $1 from a year ago. Investors may want to hear from executives about media reports of possible gasoline shortages in parts of the country due in part to logjams in the supply chain. One challenge that recently cropped up is finding qualified fuel truck drivers to transport the product to gas stations. 
Crude slipped again this morning, falling back toward $63 a barrel on apparent demand worries. There does seem to be major resistance near $65. The front-month futures contract knocked against that again yesterday and ran into sellers.
The same thing might be happening in the bond market, where 10-year yields can’t make much progress above 1.65%. A move above that earlier this week didn’t find much traction, and we’re back near 1.64% this morning.

That’s because, historically, the strongest period for the market tends to be the stretch between November-April, with May-October lagging, according to The Stock Trader’s Almanac. 
Whether May will be a selling month remains to be seen, but there seems to be a sense that history might repeat given how elevated many stocks are. The Nasdaq Composite (COMP) and S&P 500 Index (SPX) both gained more than 5% in April, with the latter closing at a record high on Thursday before succumbing to some profit-taking on the last trading day of the week.
Selling pressure doesn’t seem to be a feature of this morning’s trading, with the path of least resistance appearing to be to the upside. Investors seem optimistic given the backdrop of a stronger-than-expected earnings season, improving economic data, a strong vaccine rollout in the United States, government stimulus, and easy monetary policy from the Fed.
Earnings Season Going Better Than Expected
With earnings season in full swing, investors have plenty to digest as they try to form a picture of the market in the near term based on corporate performance, executive commentary, and company outlooks. 
Investors can learn a lot from executives during corporate earnings calls discussing the reopening economy and emerging consumer trends they’re seeing.
So far most of the SPX companies that have reported have beaten earnings expectations. On Friday, FactSet said that more SPX companies are beating earnings estimates for the first quarter than average, and that those beats are coming with a wider-than-average margin. 
Of the 60% of SPX companies reporting first-quarter earnings, 86% of them had reported earnings that exceeded estimates, above the five-year average of 74%, FactSet said Friday. (See more on earnings below.)

No longer is going to a physical store and browsing the aisles the only method of shopping. More browsing than ever is taking place online, more sales than ever are occurring in digital spaces and more pressure on retailers is driving change – and new challenges – that continue to alter the shopping experience.

Understanding these changes are key to creating successful customer journeys. More importantly, though, is understanding what the modern consumer seeks. A series of recent reports provide some insights into the consumer of 2021 and what they say is important to them, giving retailers and brands a road map to fulfilling consumer needs.

The Face Of The Online Consumer

In Jungle Scout's Q1 2021 Consumer Trends Report, consumers reported that free shipping was the top reason to shop online. That jumped up from the fourth spot in the Q4 report, suggesting shipping cost was less of a factor during the busy holiday season. Lower prices, which was sixth in the Q4 report, jumped up to No. 2 in Q1. Convenience was third in Q1 after topping the survey in Q4.

The report, which surveyed 1,005 U.S. consumers Jan. 26-29, 2021, found that 46% of consumers leave items in their online cart and forget about them, suggesting brands have some work to do to convert these customers.

When it comes to which online retailers are most popular, it's no surprise that Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) topped the list, with 73% of respondents saying they shopped at Amazon.com at least once in the past three months. Amazon was followed by Walmart (NYSE: WMT) at 40%; eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) and Target (NYSE: TGT), 18% each; and Kohl's (NYSE: KSS) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), 10% each.

When it comes to returns, 31% of respondents said they would return a product bought from an online store. That number increased slightly, to 32% for Amazon shoppers, but both numbers remained below the 37% who said they were likely to return an item at a physical store.

Consumers looking for items often start with Amazon, with 74% of them saying that is their first online stop. Search engines were popular as well, with 65% saying that's where they start researching items. A brand or retailer's website was cited by 38% followed by social networks Facebook, 31%; YouTube, 29%; Instagram, 21%; and TikTok, 10%. (Note: Respondents could select multiple answers.)

When it comes to getting a product in a timely manner, though, the clear choice is Amazon, with 64% saying they turn to Jeff Bezo's platform.

Nearly three-quarters of consumers – 73% – believe the majority of shopping will happen online in the future and 43% said they would be fine if they never shopped in a physical store again. A full 58% of consumers shop online at least once a week if not more.

The ride-sharing company saw shares post big pre-market gains after reporting a narrower than expected loss, above consensus revenue and solid guidance for the rest of the year. Now Uber (NYSE: UBER), which reports this afternoon, has a tough act to follow. Shares of LYFT spiked more than 5% in pre-market trading. 
“More people started moving again” in Q1, LYFT’s chief financial officer said, which is the kind of thing you want to hear if you’re excited about getting back to normal. Average daily ride volume grew each month, Lyft said, with the steepest recovery in March. And for people who miss traveling by plane, the good news is that LYFT’s average daily airport rides were up more than 65% in April relative to January. 
What’s more impressive is that all this happened even when most people weren’t back at work yet. More companies are starting to talk about getting employees back to the office, so that could give ride-sharing companies an opportunity to do even better. 
Then this morning, General Motors (NYSE: GM) easily beat Wall Street’s earnings expectations but came up just short of consensus on revenue. It looks like investors aren’t punishing the company for that small miss, as shares rose more than 3% in the pre-market hours. Maybe the fact that GM reaffirmed its 2021 guidance was enough to soothe any hurt feelings over revenue.
The reaffirmed guidance from GM included an impact from the global shortage of semiconductor chips, by the way, so it doesn’t look like that’s going to necessarily handicap the company. This was an important thing for them to get across. 
The solid earnings from these two appeared to help stabilize a market that was going downhill yesterday. Major indices built in slight gains ahead of the opening bell. Earnings drive stocks, and the nice run of earnings continues.
Forward progress early today might also reflect a bit of spillover buying after yesterday’s late comeback from the lowest points of the day, but it’s unclear how much buying interest remains with stocks still near record highs. It looks like we may bounce around in a range for a while as we get ready for the jobs report on Friday (see more below). There’s also ISM Services data later today.
Not Like Old Times: Yellen Rate Hike Talk Spooks Stocks
Maybe you remember that time when, as Fed Chair, Janet Yellen gave Wall Street a scare by talking about how rates might need to rise to make sure the economy doesn’t overheat. 
If you don’t, it’s understandable, because it’s hard to remember many occasions when Yellen—  a well-known dove—did that back in the day. While Yellen did raise rates slowly over the course of her time at the Fed, she did it very cautiously and without fireworks. Also, the economy really wasn’t in much danger then of overheating, with slow growth being the big problem. That’s why it might have felt a bit disconcerting to hear those words from her as Treasury Secretary yesterday, and helps explain the market’s subsequent dive.
It wouldn’t be fair, however, to just blame Yellen. First of all, she didn’t specifically call for a rate hike. She just said rates might have to rise to avoid the economy overheating, implying more of a natural progression considering the strong growth we’ve seen so far this year. Already, many analysts see the 10-year yield on a path back toward 2%, though that’s separate from the Fed raising rates. 
Yellen also walked back her words later Tuesday, according to The Wall Street Journal, saying she wasn’t predicting nor recommending that the Federal Reserve raise interest rates, and doesn’t think there’s going to be an inflation problem. 
Second, the market was on its heels even before Yellen spoke. Almost none of the big Tech companies got a lift last week despite overwhelmingly impressive earnings results, and some “mega-cap” Tech stocks like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) still haven’t made it back to their February highs even ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['News', 'Earnings', 'Government', 'Regulations', 'FDA', 'Markets', 'Tech', 'Media', 'General']",0.99792,Negative,https://amp.benzinga.com/amp/content/20965987

Tech stocks rose in pre-market trading, but can they maintain those early gains? That’s one question hanging over Wall Street today. 
We’ll talk more about the trauma in Tech lower down. First, let’s take care of some data and earnings business. 
There’s more good news on the jobs front today as initial weekly jobless claims fell to 498,000, well below the 527,000 Wall Street had expected. It’s the fourth week in a row below 600,000 and the first reading below 500,000 since before the pandemic. Having the number come in below 500,000 is going to set up some high expectations for tomorrow’s nonfarm payrolls report. 
On the earnings side of things, Uber (NYSE: UBER) shares didn’t receive the same kind of love in overnight trading as competitor Lyft (NASDAQ: LYFT) did the night before. Instead, UBER turned lower after the company reported a narrower than expected quarterly loss following the close yesterday. A miss on the revenue line and hints of rising expenses might help explain why investors were less enthusiastic. Most companies missing on revenue have gotten taken out to the woodshed this earnings season.
That’s what’s happening to Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA) in pre-market trading, too. Its shares are down 5% following a miss on revenue and a beat on earnings per share for the Covid vaccine company. MRNA, along with BioNTech (NASDAQ: BNTX)—another Covid vaccine maker—might be getting hurt more by the growing momentum among global policymakers to waive patent protection for Covid vaccine makers. President Biden yesterday added his name to the list of those supporting the idea. 
Another company we’ve heard a lot about over the last year, Peloton (NASDAQ: PTON), is scheduled to report after the close one day after shares tanked following its treadmill recall. Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) and Square (NYSE: SQ) are other earnings reports to consider watching today, with ROKU another good chance to check how streaming demand is looking. “Gross payment volume,” or GPV, is a key metric to watch when you check SQ’s earnings. 
Stocks have really entered a holding pattern here. If you check the close of the S&P 500 Index (SPX) yesterday vs. its close on April 15, it’s a three-point difference. A holding pattern would probably sound good right now to anyone with lots of Tech stocks in their portfolio. The Nasdaq 100 (NDX) is down nearly 4% since April 15. 
Technically, however, both the SPX and the Nasdaq (COMP) have remained above their 50-day moving averages. Any test of those levels could be interesting to watch for signs of either buying the dip or a new wave of selling. The 50-day MA for the SPX is 4019, and for COMP is 13,513. 
Hurry Up And Wait For Jobs Report
Yesterday and today appear to be mostly about range-bound trading ahead of tomorrow’s April payrolls report. As a reminder, consensus on Wall Street is for a gain of one million jobs and a decline in the unemployment rate to 5.8%. 
The same numbers were 916,000 and 6% in March, so we’re talking incremental improvements. Even if the data meet expectations, the economy will remain way behind where it was pre-Covid on the jobs front, so it’s important not to let a few good numbers cause anyone to forget that. 
As always, it’s also important to check the mix when you look at job numbers. In March, most of the growth was concentrated in lower-paying services jobs as reopening gained steam.  Overall wages actually fell. There’s nothing wrong with leisure and hospitality jobs like bar-tending or waiting tables, but it would be better for the economy to see ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['News', 'Earnings', 'Guidance', 'Markets', 'Tech', 'General']",1.0,Negative,https://amp.benzinga.com/amp/content/20991352

Well, we’ve started to observe a little more caution creeping into the market. 
It’s arguably there in bonds, where the 10-year yield continues to pivot around 1.6%, well off its March high and not getting much traction. 
It’s also evident in the Nasdaq (COMP) and Russell 2000 (RUT), both of which can’t seem to find a pathway upward. Tech shares slid again early Tuesday in pre-market trading, with “FAANG” names like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) again taking it on the chin. Palantir Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: PLTR) fell double-digits after reporting earnings, with analysts pointing to higher than expected compensation costs. 
Even though the COMP—heavily weighted toward Tech—is just 3% from all-time highs, when it ran into struggles last month it may have made some investors feel more cautious about being “all in” to stocks. We’re starting to see more interest in fixed income than earlier this year. 
Caution is also evident in the latest batch of retail investor data for April (see more below), which showed a slight pullback. 
Also, gold is up to well above $1,800 an ounce—a three-month high. It’s climbed about 10% from its 2021 lows.
One possible issue is a lack of catalysts. The big tug-of-war between growth and value continues to play out, with value winning yesterday’s battle in a huge way. Other than that, there’s not much of a story to trade on. 
Some had anticipated a strong April jobs report and thought that might provide a new storyline—namely a change in the Fed’s thinking on tapering monetary support. 
Instead we got a lackluster jobs number that kind of pushed that debate back another month, and the monetary “party” continues. Wage pressure was capped because of the jobs growth being concentrated in the leisure and hospitality sectors, something that might continue. That takes inflationary pressure off the Fed, to some extent. 
Tech laid an egg yesterday as stocks like Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) got creamed, but it’s possible some people will continue to view dips as a buying opportunity. It’s like in football. If a play keeps working, you keep running it. Running the “buy the dip” route in Tech has probably made some people a lot of money over the last year. At some point it will end, absolutely, but no one knows when that will happen. 
Some Investors Stepped Back In April
The April Investor Movement Index® (IMXSM) from TD Ameritrade showed clients tracked by the report reducing their exposure to stocks just slightly during the month. It was the first time that happened since last November. The headline number fell to 8.14 in April, down from its March score of 8.21. It’s still historically high, by the way.
The IMX is TD Ameritrade’s proprietary, behavior-based index, aggregating Main Street investor positions and activity to measure what investors actually were doing and how they were positioned in the markets.

But it also seems that investors may be coming to grips with the prospect of higher prices, especially those that buy into the Fed’s view of “transitory” inflation.
The government’s April producer price index registered a 0.6% increase, ahead of a Briefing.com consensus forecast of a 0.3% gain. The PPI news comes one day after the government’s April consumer price index rose far more than expected, with the core CPI gaining 0.9% when a Briefing.com consensus had expected that inflation metric to rise just 0.3%.
The market, as gauged by equity index futures this morning, didn’t seem to react too much initially to the producer inflation data. Despite concerns about inflation, it appears that yesterday’s bad news on the inflationary front cushioned the blow of the PPI data somewhat. It may also be that the PPI news is somewhat offset by a better-than-expected reading on initial jobless claims, which came in at 473,000 when 510,000 had been expected in a Briefing.com consensus.
Rising inflation has been worrying Wall Street as investors fear the Fed may have to respond by tapering its asset purchases or raising its key interest rate sooner than expected. Inflation expectations have also been hurting growth stocks, including big tech-related names, because expectations of rising costs can dent the outlook for profitability for these companies.
The Gas Pipeline Metaphor
But at least some of this was expected. To some degree, the reopening of the economy was bound to have a “coiled spring” effect on demand, but with supply still coming online after a lengthy shutdown, it’s a mismatch that could be transitory. It’s kind of like those looking to buy gas on the East Coast. Though the pipeline has been restarted, it will be a little while before the local markets stabilize.
Despite the selling this week, it’s worth remembering that we’ve seen record highs recently, so stocks were probably due for a bit of a pullback. Some of the selling in recent weeks has been cushioned by a buy-the-dip mentality in tech stocks. While that seems like it may be the case again today, we’ll have to see if investors keep turning to that playbook.
In corporate news, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) made a U-turn on bitcoin. The electric vehicle maker has stopped accepting the cryptocurrency for automobile purchases out of concern about “rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions,” according to a tweet from CEO Elon Musk.
He said the company won’t be selling any of its bitcoin holdings and would use it for transactions “as soon as mining transitions to more sustainable energy.” Nevertheless, bitcoin was down more than 7% this morning, and other cryptocurrencies appeared to be falling in sympathy, despite Musk saying cryptocurrency is a “good idea” that “has a promising future” and adding that Tesla is looking at cryptocurrencies besides bitcoin that use less than 1% of bitcoin’s energy per transaction.

CEO Tim Cook got the ball rolling by welcoming the participants of the virtual conference and providing them with information about what to expect.
New iOS:  Craig Federighi, senior vice president of software engineering, announced iOS 15, the next iteration of its OS powering the iPhone.
With the new OS, FaceTime, the company's video calling app, will have spatial audio allowing the conversation to flow as easily as they do face-to-face. The new OS will provide two powerful options for the microphone: voice isolation that blocks out ambient voices and wide-spectrum, which is when the mic picks up all sounds.
The new OS also allows generating FaceTime links for scheduling calls and share them anywhere. Grid view and portrait mode were also introduced.
Apple announced SharePlay for shared listening and watching experiences, while on a FaceTime call. FaceTime will now support non-Apple devices like Android smartphones.
iMessage users will have access to new options to collage and stack photos for sharing. The company also announced Focus, which lets users focus while doing other work. Notifications will now have a Notification Summary.

Tweed’s philosophy appears to have survived well into the 21st century, at least according to Jan Eeckhout, author of the new book “The Profit Paradox: How Thriving Firms Threaten the Future of Work.”
In his book, Eeckhout details how a relatively small number of companies have created an off-kilter environment over the past four decades in which they have consolidated economic controls to a point where they can exist without fear of either competition or government regulation. As a result of this situation, workforce wages have mostly stagnated and prices on consumer and industrial goods are in constant ascension.
Eeckhout, who is the ICREA Research Professor at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona and previously taught at the University of Pennsylvania, University College London, Princeton University and New York University, spoke with Benzinga about “The Profit Paradox” and the state of global macroeconomy.
Benzinga: How did you come about with the thesis for your work?
JE: The thesis is based on facts, and we see two things. First of all, with the new fast technological change that's going on, we see that those highly productive firms — these very big innovators — have become very profitable, which is a good thing because innovation is a good thing. That's the driver of the economy, that's how we get progress and growth.
At the same time, this past ecological change has also led to a lopsidedness within the industries, because an Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) or a Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) is so productive and is so much better than anyone else that they actually grab the entire market.
Still, couldn’t an argument be made that these companies are giving the public what it wants?
JE: I'm the first one who loves Amazon, because I get a lot of stuff at a low price and it's very convenient. But the reason why they can do it is because our central tenets of competition don't work.

On Wednesday, a report in Wall Street Journal said an internal project of Apple, codenamed Casper, is exploring the possibility of setting up an Apple primary care network.
Apple analyst and Loup Ventures Managing Partner Gene Munster sees this as unlikely and instead sees Apple's health ambitions anchored on devices and data that can be leveraged by clinicians for care.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) has come under the scanner of German antitrust regulators for alleged anti-competitive practices.
What Happened:  The Bundeskartellamt, or the Federal Cartel Office, has initiated proceedings against Apple, in accordance with an amendment to the German Competition Act that came into force in January.
As the first step into the process, the regulator will now look into whether Apple, with its proprietary operating system, iOS, has created a digital ecosystem around its iPhone that extends across several markets.
The regulator also referred to Apple's many products and a host of device-related services the company offers, including the App Store, iCloud, AppleCare, Apple Music, Apple Arcade and Apple TV+.
""Besides assessing the company's position in these areas, we will, among other aspects, examine its extensive integration across several market levels, the magnitude of its technological and financial resources and its access to data,"" said Andreas Mundt, president of the Bundeskartellamt.

Product Activity Among OEMs Varies: OEMs are pursuing a range of strategies, with product pipelines focused on everything from traditional high-volume models to lower-volume EVs, analyst John Murphy said in a note.
The product pipelines are experiencing notable volatility due to a number of delays, pivots and pushes to product launches, including an acceleration in alternative powertrain launches, the analyst said. 
The Rise Of EVs:  For the first time in history, over half of the powertrain offerings across all new models to be launched over the model years 202-2025 will be alternative ones, he said.
A number of these, Murphy said, will be variant offerings of existing internal combustion models, most commonly hybrids.
The analyst also expects a slew of EVs to be launched under standalone nameplates.
In terms of number of nameplate offerings by powertrain type, ICEs, though still dominant, are seeing their lead shrinking, Murphy said.

The months-long consolidation pattern had the stock trading into a tightening pattern, making lower highs and higher lows on the daily chart.
Despite a number of options traders purchasing large put contracts on the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY), and Apple being a market leader, options traders took the other side of Apple and purchased a massive amount of call contracts. Together, these options traders bought over $4.22 million worth of bullish Apple calls.
Why It’s Important: When a sweep order occurs, it indicates the trader wanted to get into a position quickly and is anticipating an imminent large move in stock price. A sweeper pays market price for the call option instead of placing a bid, which sweeps the order book of multiple exchanges to fill the order immediately.
These types of call option orders are usually made by institutions, and retail investors can find watching for sweepers useful because it indicates “smart money” has entered into a position.
AAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple were trading up 1.2% to $132 at publication time.

The report broke down unusual trading activity from members of Congress and also showed the members who beat the returns of the S&P 500.
Here are the highlights of the report.
What Happened: The year 2022 was the worst for the S&P 500, as tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY), since 2008.
Despite the bad returns for the overall market, 26 members of Congress beat the S&P 500 with their 2022 return, according to a new detailed report from Unusual Whales.
In 2022, 131 members of Congress filed stock and options trading disclosures. This figure was down from 147 members in 2021. The report tracked $788 million in trades from more than 12,700 transactions. The number of transactions was similar to 2021, with around $189 million less traded in 2022 than the previous year.
The report found House Republicans had more than 1,000 fewer trades in 2022. House Democrats had over 1,000 more trades in 2022 compared to the previous year.
Democrats saw an average return of -1.76% and Republicans saw an average return of 0.4%, both beating the -18% return of the S&P 500 in 2022.
Over the past 10 years, about 10% of fund managers outperformed the S&P 500, according to SPIVA data, while in 2022, about 5% of total Congress outperformed.
When just comparing the Congressional members who traded — just 131 of the possible 535 — 26 beat the market. That equates to 20%, a much higher rate than professional money managers over time.
Here were the top 10 members of Congress by 2022 return, according to the report:

(NASDAQ: TSLA) bull Cathie Wood-run Ark Invest on Friday gave a new perspective on the firm's long-term price target for the stock of the electric vehicle maker.
What Happened:  Ark’s 2026 price target for Tesla stock would be about $500 per share, based on its EV business alone, the firm’s analyst Tasha Keeney said. The projection is adjusted for the 3-for-1 stock split that became effective on Aug. 25, 2022.
This represents additional context to the 2026 (pre-split) price target of $4,600 the firm announced in mid-April 2022. 
Keeney noted that the firm is removing autonomous driving and any form of ride-hail from the valuation framework. The firm believes that these two factors will drive more than 60% of Tesla’s value over the next five years.
She noted that the $500 per share projection is more than a four-times increase from the stock's current levels.

On Monday, the market squandered the morning session's gains and declined through the afternoon to close on a mixed note. Selling set in as traders sifted through the comments of two Fed officials. The broader S&P 500 Index, which was up a little over 1.5% points in early afternoon trading, gave back all the gains thereafter and ended marginally lower.
Technology, consumer discretionary, material and utility stocks saw marked strength, while consumer staple and healthcare stocks came under selling pressure.

The data suggested that companies were likely to report results aligned with the analyst and Street estimates. Coupled with product initiatives and FX headwinds that moderate in 2Q23E, the analyst believes both Match and Bumble will likely have a solid 2023E.

For the fourth time in four years, the jackpot on the Mega Millions lottery drawing has topped the $1 billion mark.
Here’s a look at the historic jackpot and what you could buy with the after-tax lump sum winnings.
What Happened: The Mega Millions drawing on Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2023, is currently listed at $1.1 billion, which is the third-largest jackpot in the game’s history.
The $1.1 billion jackpot trails only the $1.537 billion won in 2018 and the $1.337 billion won in July 2022.
Tickets cost $2 to play with an additional $1 option cost for a multiplier that raises the nonjackpot winning payouts.
Five white balls are drawn numbered 1 to 70 and a gold Mega Ball numbered 1 to 25 is drawn. A person has to match all six to win the overall jackpot.
Players can select their own numbers for their tickets, with lucky numbers, birthdays and anniversaries often among the favorite selections. Players can also receive random numbers by selecting an easy pick/quick pick.
The overall odds to win the jackpot are 1 in 302,575,350. The odds to win a prize of at least $4 are 1 in 24.
If no one matched all six balls Tuesday night, the jackpot will increase ahead of a drawing on Friday, Jan. 13, 2022.
How Much Do You Win?: The jackpot for Tuesday’s drawing stands at $1.1 billion with a listed cash payment of $568.7 million.
The jackpot is paid out over a 30-year period with an initial payment upon winning and an annual payment for the next 29 years. Each annual payment goes up by 5% to attempt to offset inflation.
Given the current high inflation era that we are in, a person who wins the jackpot is immediately tasked with choosing whether they want all the money upfront or to be paid annually and if they think the 5% is enough to offset ...","['News', 'Penny Stocks', 'Cryptocurrency', 'Entertainment', 'Top Stories', 'Markets', 'General']",0.99983,Neutral,https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/30361537

What Happened: At the beginning, Apple plans to use its own display in the highest-end Apple Watches by the end of 2024, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
The screen swap will upgrade the displays from the current organic LED to microLED, with Apple eventually bringing this display tech to other devices, including the iPhone, reported Bloomberg.
Apple did not immediately respond to Benzinga's request for comment.
The Tim Cook-led company has begun testing the microLED displays on the Apple Watch Ultra, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.

What Happened: On Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2022, the best of movies and television were honored in a broadcast on NBC and Peacock, both units of Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA). The awards show had a strong presence from streaming companies, with several among the most nominated.
Two of the big winners came with ties to The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS). “Abbott Elementary,” which airs on ABC, won the Best Comedy television award. “The Banshees of Inisherin,” which came from Searchlight Pictures, won Best Picture for movies in the musical or comedy category.
Disney unit Marvel also set a record with actress Angela Bassett becoming the first Marvel actor to win a Golden Globe for their role. Marvel has had huge box office success with $11.1 billion in the domestic box office, but has been shut out of many awards shows. Bassett’s win was one of the few awards for any of the top-grossing movies of 2022.
HBO, a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD), was a big winner at the Golden Globes. The company got wins for Best Drama for Television with “House of the Dragon” and for Best Limited Series for Television with “The White Lotus.”

Several critical darlings received numerous nominations and many of the top nominated movies from the recent Golden Globes awards show also heard their names called again.
Two of the big questions from the nominations centered around the awards success of movies on streaming platforms and big box office movies.
The 95th Academy Awards will air on ABC on March 12.
Can Netflix Win The Big Award?: Streaming giant Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) had been an award favorite in recent years, and at the Golden Globes it recently won three awards from its 14 nominations.
Netflix was once again nominated for top honors in the Best Picture category with its “All Quiet on the Western Front,” a movie it acquired the rights to in 2020.
The anti-war German film is an adaptation of a 1929 novel and was also the subject of the award-winning 1930 film of the same name, which took home the Best Picture that year.
Netflix's “All Quiet on the Western Front” received nine total nominations, ranking as the second most nominated movie behind only the 10 for “Everything Everywhere All at Once.”
Netflix received a total of 15 nominations, which was among the best for streaming companies. Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS) had 22 total nominations, including 12 for titles related to its Disney+ streaming platform.

Apple will report F1Q23 results after the market on February 2.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) is releasing its fourth-quarter financial report after the close Thursday. Here’s what investors need to know ahead of the print. 
The consensus estimate for Amazon’s fourth-quarter revenue is $145 billion, in line with the e-commerce giant’s recent guidance. Amazon said during its third-quarter call in October that it expected fourth-quarter revenue to be between $140 billion and $148 billion, equating to year-over-year growth of between 2% to 8%.
The company made headlines on Tuesday for illegally resisting unionization efforts by its employees, as per a National Labor Relations Board judge.
Markets have been responding positively in anticipation of the call, with the company's stock gaining almost 20% in the last month and 4.6% in the last five days.
Hard Times Ahead For Big Tech?
On Monday, Barclays analyst Ross Sandler cut the price target for Amazon from $140 to $130 and maintained an Overweight rating.

Brady previously announced his retirement from the league in February 2022 before deciding one month later that he would return.
Brady said in his retirement video on social media on Wednesday that this time he is stepping away from playing ""for good."" 
Brady was the oldest player in the NFL for the 2022-2023 season. Drafted 199th overall in the 2000 NFL Draft on April 6, 2000, a lot has changed since Brady first entered the league.
Here’s a look at 23 things that weren’t around when Brady joined the NFL.
Cryptocurrency: Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) was founded in 2009, following a white paper released the previous year. The market capitalization of Bitcoin is more than $400 billion and one of many cryptocurrencies that are now readily available to trade by consumers, including on the FTX app endorsed by Brady.
Twitter: Social media platform Twitter Inc was founded in March 2006. Brady has 2.8 million followers on the social media platform as of today.
Facebook: Social media platform Facebook, which is owned by Meta Platforms inc (NASDAQ: META), was founded in 2004, two years after Brady joined the NFL.
Instagram: Photo and video sharing social media platform Instagram, which is owned by Meta Platforms, launched in 2010. Brady has more than 13 million followers on Instagram, but trails his ex-wife, model Gisele Bundchen at 20.5 million.
iPhone: Now one of the most popular smartphones in the world, the iPhone wasn’t launched until 2007 by Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL). Brady couldn’t own an iPhone until his eighth season in the NFL.
Netflix Streaming: Now used by hundreds of millions of people worldwide, the ability to stream movies and television shows from Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) wasn’t a reality when Brady joined the league. Netflix launched in 1998 as a DVD by mail service and would later add streaming in 2007.

The major averages opened modestly lower and moved sideways until the Fed rate announcement.

How Apple Did On Key Q1 Metrics:  Cupertino, California-based Apple reported first-quarter earnings per share of $1.88, missing the consensus estimate of $1.94 per share and declining from the year-ago EPS of $2.01.
Apple’s top line fell 5% year-over-year to $117.2 billion, missing the consensus estimate of $121.1 billion.
The December quarter, which is Apple’s fiscal first quarter, is also its busiest and seasonally strong quarter. Expectations were muted this time around.
On the fourth-quarter earnings call held in late October, CFO Luca Maestri  said the year-over-year growth in revenue would slow down in the December quarter. He flagged a 10-percentage-point impact from an adverse currency effect, macroeconomic challenges slowing Service sector revenue growth and a substantial decline in Mac revenue due to tougher comparisons.
The first quarter of 2022 benefited from the launch and associated fill of the newly redesigned MacBook Pro with M1 chips. The dollar has weakened since then, amid the Fed’s normalization of rates.

Stocks gap-opened higher on Thursday, capitalizing on positive tech earnings. The major averages then showed divergence, with the Dow Industrials languishing mostly below the unchanged line before closing lower. The S&P 500 Index and the Nasdaq Composite hovered above the flat line through the session before closing notably higher.

While ChatGPT has been shown to pass major tests and exams, some have issued warning signs about the dangers that artificial intelligence can have.
Cuban is among those sounding the alarm on potential issues with ChatGPT.
“It’s gonna get worse,” Cuban said. “If you play with ChatGPT at all, the next battle isn’t about Twitter, control of Twitter, it’s who controls the AI models and the information that goes in them.”

Benchmark: Kurnos said Roku crushed fourth quarter expectations and provided a first quarter outlook that could have some skepticism.
“We can understand why many of our peers reacted with open skepticism, which we think highlights how far out of favor Roku has fallen,” Kurnos said.
The analyst said it’s hard to argue that Roku didn’t gain market share in the fourth quarter and could have a chance to gain more in the future.
“Roku has a chance, in our view, to prove that they have substantially more value in the ecosystem than most give them credit for.”
Stephens: Zangler called the fourth quarter results a significant beat by Roku.

Companies are looking for an edge with the release or original shows and movies, live sports and other exclusives.
Here’s a look at the latest from Paramount Global (NASDAQ: PARA) (NASDAQ: PARAA) and how it stacks up to rivals.
What Happened: Paramount Global reported revenue of $8.13 billion in the fourth quarter, which was up 2% year-over-year. The company reported direct-to-consumer revenue of $1.4 billion, up 30% year-over-year.
In the fourth quarter, Paramount added 9.9 million subscribers for its Paramount+ streaming platform to hit a total of more than 56 million. The company added 10.8 million total global direct-to-consumer subscribers in the fourth quarter to bring the total to 77 million across several platforms.
“Paramount continues to demonstrate the success of its global multiplatform strategy, with popular content at its core. Nowhere was this more evident than in the growth of Paramount+, which added a record 9.9 million subscribers in the fourth quarter,” Paramount CEO Bob Bakish said.
Paramount also announced it will raise the prices of its streaming service as it rebrands to combine with Showtime in the third quarter of 2023. The new platform will be called Paramount+ with Showtime.

With a hit show returning for a potential last season, the launch of a new sports rights package, and a series with an impressive all-star cast, AppleTV+ could have a big couple of months ahead.
What Happened: The battle for streaming rights to professional sports leagues could be one of the biggest storylines in the streaming sector. Apple secured the rights to Major League Soccer for 10 years, with the deal set to kick off in late February.
The deal will see AppleTV+ become the home of MLS coverage. Apple paid an estimated $2.5 billion for the sports rights in one of its largest streaming bets since launching AppleTV+.
Along with streaming games, Apple is also launching MLS Season Pass, a new subscription service for soccer fans in over 100 countries and regions. The MLS Season Pass has a cost of $99 per season or $79 per season for existing AppleTV+ subscribers. Monthly subscriptions are also available for $14.99 and $12.99, respectively.
The MLS 2023 regular season begins on Feb. 25 and Apple will be at the forefront of the league, which could make the streaming company a big player in the sports space.

Here’s a look at how much artificial intelligence is being name-checked by top tech execs this earnings season. 
What Happened: Thanks to surging interest in ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence-themed tools helping provide answers to users, companies have been aggressive with advancing their own AI technology or utilizing ChatGPT.
An additional investment in ChatGPT parent company OpenAI by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) may have accelerated this trend. 
Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) reported quarterly earnings results Wednesday, and ChatGPT and artificial intelligence were among the top themes discussed by executives.
Nvidia beat the Street's earnings per share and revenue estimates and also provided guidance that came in ahead of expectations. 
“We are set to help customers take advantage of breakthroughs in generative AI and large language models. Our new AI supercomputer, with H100 and its Transformer Engine and Quantum-2 networking fabric, is in full production,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said.

What Happened: Netflix and the NFL partnered on a new docuseries called “Quarterback” that will feature several quarterbacks from each season. The first season will highlight Kirk Cousins (Minnesota Vikings), Marcus Mariota (Atlanta Falcons) and Super Bowl LVII-winning quarterback Patrick Mahomes (Kansas City Chiefs).
The docuseries will feature behind-the-scenes footage from the 2022 NFL season from its start to end with Mahomes, Cousins and Mariota all mic’d up during each game. The series will also show off-field activities and interactions with the players’ families.
Among the highlights shared by the NFL for the series will be a look at the Vikings completing the biggest comeback in NFL history, Mariota taking over as the starting quarterback for the Falcons and Mahomes winning both the regular season MVP and Super Bowl LVII MVP trophies.
“I’m excited for fans to get an exclusive, behind-the-scenes look at an unforgettable season for the entire Chiefs organization and for my family,” Mahomes said. “From welcoming home a new baby in the middle of the season to welcoming the Lombardi trophy back to Kansas City, our crew was there for it all.”

Opportunities Ahead But Be Astute
Please click here for a chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

Plenty of opportunities are ahead in 2024, but you need to be astute as to when to buy, what to buy, and how to buy if you want market beating returns.  
The chart shows that during the Santa Claus rally, the stock market did not hit the top band of the resistance zone. In the very short term, this is a negative.
The chart shows the stock market has pulled back to the low band of the resistance zone. To maintain bullish posture, the stock market needs to not go much below the bottom band of the resistance zone.
There are likely many stops right below the bottom band of the resistance zone.  If the stock market starts dropping, hunt and destroy algorithms will go into action and take out the stops. This is the reason that The Arora Report recommends not placing stops at obvious points.
Historically, after the stops are taken out, there is a bounce. Officially, the period for the Santa Claus rally will end at the close tomorrow.
RSI shown on the chart is on a sell signal, but the pattern is such that it can quickly reverse to a buy signal.
RSI on the chart shows negative divergence. In plain English, this means that RSI and the price are moving differently. This is a negative in the very short term.
In the early trade this morning, there is considerable tax related selling. Historically, such selling is common after a strong year. The reason is that investors did not want to sell in 2023 to avoid paying capital gains taxes for the 2023 tax year.  By selling now, they have successfully postponed paying capital gains tax by one year.
As the year starts, investors are again making the classic mistake that we warned you about late last year. The classic mistake investors make at this time of the year is to act on the following:

2024 year end targets from Wall Street strategists
Sector recommendations from Wall Street strategists


In our 40 years in the markets, a vast majority of the time, Wall Street strategists are wrong. To understand the recent history, consider the following:

Right now, investors are worshiping permabulls and deriding permabears.
In 2023 at the start of the new year, investors were worshiping permabears and deriding permabulls. What did the stock market do? The stock market went up.
In 2022 at the start of the new year, investors were worshiping permabulls and deriding permabears. What did the stock market do? The stock market went down.

New Economic Data
Please click here for a chart of Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ: QQQ).
Note the following:

The chart shows tech stocks have fallen back into the support zone.
RSI on the chart shows tech stocks are near oversold.
The stock market has a consensus now that everything is going to be immaculate – the landing, the Fed, interest rates, earnings, adoption of AI, Russia, China, and the Middle East.
The stock market is assuming a 90% probability of seven rate cuts.
The stock market is going to face new economic data today:

ISM Manufacturing Index will be released at 10am ET. The consensus is 47.1%.
JOLTS report will be released at 10am ET.


The stock market will also face minutes from the last FOMC meeting at 2pm ET. Powell was dovish in the press conference, flipping 180 degrees. At The Arora Report, we will be reading the Fed minutes to see if the 180 degree flip was unanimous or if there was dissension.
If the new data and the Fed minutes are supportive of immaculate everything, expect a rip roaring rally and new highs.
If the data is not supportive of immaculate everything, expect momo gurus to come up with a new narrative to try to run up the stock market.
Market mechanics are neutral as of this writing in the premarket but can easily swing in either direction after the data and Fed minutes.
Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin has made two key points this morning:

Rate hikes are not off the table.
The soft landing is at risk.


As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in the protection band, which strikes the optimum balance between various crosscurrents. Please scroll down to see the protection band.

The “magnificent seven” stocks — Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) — collectively represent about 30% of the S&P 500’s market cap.

The analyst noted that while semiconductor content increases in automobiles are a clear trend, supply has generally caught up to demand. 
Shorter lead times, increasing inventory, higher interest rates, and rising sticker prices are causing a demand slowdown. The analyst flagged that this slower demand environment is continuing.
Cassidy expected to learn some details on the current automotive market at CES this week. 
The analyst will meet with companies with automotive exposure, including Ambarella, Innoviz, Navitas, onsemi, Qualcomm, and Synaptics. 
Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ: QCOM) has been aggressively updating its Snapdragon XR Platform for many years. 
Cassidy noted Qualcomm as being the leader in virtual reality SoCs. 
Qualcomm's advantage is the pricing, technology, and ecosystem of support leveraged from the Snapdragon core design refined over years of high-volume production in handsets. 
The virtual reality headset market will eventually find the correct feature set that meets consumers' needs, as per Cassidy.
Arm Holdings Plc's (NASDAQ: ARM) licensing pipeline for generative AI licenses is strengthening based on Cassidy's checks in Asia and Silicon Valley in December, which is additive to the already rich v9 architecture roadmap, share gains in PC, DC, and significant royalty rate increases complemented by the new CSS program.

Traders are approaching the market with caution, evaluating the gains from the previous session. The upcoming days hold several crucial catalysts, with the focus shifting to the Wednesday release of the consumer price inflation report and Friday’s eagerly anticipated big bank earnings.
Despite the cautious mood, potential factors like a billion-dollar tech merger and the swirling optimism around a spot Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) exchange-traded fund approval, coupled with the spike in oil prices, could inject some buying activity.
Cues From Monday’s Trading:
Monday witnessed a robust advancement in U.S. stocks, driven by a strong rebound in the technology sector, lifting the broader market. Both the S&P 500 Index and the Nasdaq Composite started on a positive note, steadily gaining momentum throughout the session and closing with substantial increases.
The Dow Industrials, comprising 30 stocks, initially faced a setback, primarily due to Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA) dragging down the index. This followed federal regulators’ recommendation to ground 737 Max 9s after an Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK) plane experienced a midflight blowout. However, the index managed to recover from the early dip and concluded with a modest gain. Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) spearheaded the rebound in the Dow.

During the previous month, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) surged by 3.4% compared to the previous year, surpassing the forecasted 3.2% increase. Core inflation stood at 3.9% annually, exceeding the expected 3.8%, primarily driven by the persistent high costs of shelter.
Latest Fed remarks had a chilling effect on the markets. Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin indicated his willingness to consider rate reductions once inflation is on track to reach 2%, while Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester expressed the view that March might be too early for a rate cut.
In response, traders adjusted their expectations for interest rates, with the implied probability of a March rate cut falling from 70% to around 63%, while maintaining their overall bet of six rate cuts throughout 2024.
Meanwhile, Treasury yields remained relatively stable, while the U.S. dollar strengthened by 0.2%.

The analyst noted higher service growth as Apple better monetized its installed base, adding that the  silicon roadmap will morph from PC to Servers to Autonomous, driving higher margins.
Mohan also flagged strong capital returns (buybacks, dividends) even after approaching net cash neutral.
He emphasized that the gross margin is stable to higher over time (mix, price, vertical integration).

What Happened: Hanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University, suggests that the stock market is overvalued and will likely see a decline as the anticipated recession begins to impact,  reported Business Insider on Thursday.
“As far as the outlook for stocks goes, they remain pricey, and the multiples will come off as the recession starts to bite,” said Hanke.
The S&P 500 index, after a 24% surge in 2023, is currently trading near an all-time high. Hanke, however, cautions that stocks, usually valued at multiples to company earnings, are expected to drop during a recession due to decreasing multiples and reducing earnings.
Hanke, who served as an economic advisor to Ronald Reagan and was the president of Toronto Trust Argentina in 1995, attributes the recent unstable inflation to alterations in the U.S. money supply rather than supply-chain disruptions or variations in energy and metal prices.

The firm’s deputy CIO, Dan Suzuki, believes that the current market signals could lead to a significant shift in investment dynamics.
What Happened: Richard Bernstein Advisors (RBA) has been signaling a potential investment opportunity amidst concerning signs in the stock market, reported Business Insider. The firm has been predicting a “once-in-a-generation” opportunity for months, and it appears to be on the verge of realization.
According to RBA’s Deputy CIO Dan Suzuki, the market’s current situation, particularly the dominance of a few stocks, could lead to a broader market shift. The firm’s thesis, proposed at the end of last year, suggests that the extraordinary market leadership of a small group of stocks will expand to the wider market, resulting in stronger gains for the other 493 S&P 500 stocks.
However, Suzuki warned that the corporate earnings of major tech companies are expected to decelerate in the next quarter.

What Happened: Amundi, with $2 trillion under management, anticipates a less robust economic growth in the upcoming year, which could result in a weaker performance from the leading mega-cap stocks, reported Business Insider on Saturday.
In a panel discussion at the New York Stock Exchange, Craig Sterling, the head of equity research at Amundi U.S., stated that the firm is underweight on U.S. stocks for 2024. He highlighted the significant difference between the current stock market and that of a year ago.
Despite the S&P 500’s impressive 25% surge in 2023, the “Magnificent Seven” stocks, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), were the primary drivers of this growth.

This week, Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are all set to report their quarterly results, and analysts anticipate that AI-focused companies will outperform expectations, potentially sustaining the equity market rally.
Despite this optimism, investors may exercise caution leading up to a two-day Federal Reserve meeting beginning on Tuesday. While economists expect the Fed to maintain the current high rate, traders will be attentive to signals regarding the trajectory of interest rates. Meanwhile, the Chinese market continues to experience volatility, driven by concerns about its troubled property sector.
Cues From Last Week’s Trading:
In the week ending on Jan. 26, major stock indices saw gains for a third consecutive week, buoyed by optimism surrounding the economy, inflation, and earnings. Key drivers included preliminary fourth-quarter GDP data highlighting the economy’s strength, varied earnings reports, and the December personal consumption expenditure index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure.
The S&P 500 Index reached record levels for four sessions during the week, concluding just below the record, while the Dow Industrials closed the week in record territory.

Equity and M&A experts believe that, after a year beset by volatile markets and rising interest rates, 2024 offers improving conditions for takeover deals and corporate mergers.
“Capital markets were not as open or freewheeling, and 2023 did not happen the way we thought it would,"" said Tom Miles, Head of Americas M&A at Morgan Stanley. 
“The market forces are in place that make an eventual return inevitable. It's not a question of if but when.”
One piece of the M&A jigsaw that was largely missing last year was private equity (PE) firms. These players use leveraged buyout methods to take poorly performing publicly traded companies private. The goal is to exit via an IPO or sell off the assets at a profit.
Pitchbook analyst Tim Clarke noted how higher interest rates made it more costly for PE firms to engage in deals.
“PE's share of M&A has no doubt been constrained by reduced access to leverage,” he said. During 2023, PE involvement was the lowest total recorded going back to 2005.
Overall volumes of M&A dropped to $2.4 trillion in 2023, down from $3.1 trillion in 2022 and $5.2 trillion at its 2021 peak.
But analysts at Morgan Stanley expect both corporate and PE deal-making to be stronger in 2024 after the fourth-quarter rally on equity markets in 2023.
“Corporate balance sheets are strong, financing markets are improving and CEO confidence, which is closely correlated with M&A activity, is climbing,” said Miles.
Which sectors, then, can investors expect to lead this increase in M&A activity.

What Happened: The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that despite Biden’s “America is back” declaration, his administration has maintained many of Trump’s protectionist policies. This includes keeping trade barriers in place, excluding European companies from U.S. manufacturing subsidies, and imposing stricter restrictions on Chinese access to American technology.
European diplomats are concerned that the U.S.’s economic policies, regardless of the election outcome, are no longer in their favor. This has led to doubts about the U.S.’s commitment to the rules-based trading system and the potential for economic conflict between the long-standing allies.

What Happened: Wolfenbarger, a seasoned market observer, anticipates a severe drop in the U.S. stock market and a prolonged recession. Wolfenbarger, with over three decades of investing experience, relies on a variety of economic indicators that suggest an impending downturn, according to a Business Insider report Tuesday.
Wolfenbarger, the founder of Bull and Bear Profits and a former JPMorgan banker, is particularly concerned about the consistent decline of The Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index and the longest stretch of an inverted yield curve in more than half a century. His forecast is more severe than The Conference Board’s, which predicts a two-quarter recession.
“The depth of the latest yield curve inversion has only been matched or exceeded by those preceding the Great Depression and the major recessions of the mid-1970s and early 1980s,” said Wolfenbarger.

The team’s recent findings indicate a concerning concentration of market power in the hands of the top 10 stocks on the MSCI USA Index, reminiscent of the worrisome market conditions seen two decades ago.
As Bloomberg reported Tuesday, the combined share of the MSCI USA Index’s top 10 stocks, including the prominent ‘Magnificent Seven’ technology giants, has escalated to a significant 29.3% in December. This figure approaches the historical peak of 33.2% witnessed in June 2000, during the height of the dot-com bubble.
Diversity within these top ranks is also dwindling, with only four sectors represented, a stark contrast to the historical median of six. This lack of diversification heightens the vulnerability of the market to shocks in these sectors.

Ming-Chi Kuo
Despite a successful launch, Vision Pro didn’t fly off shelves as rapidly as expected, with extended shipping times indicating initial inventory sell-out. 
Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo estimated 160,000 to 180,000 units sold during pre-orders, expressing concerns about sustained demand as shipping times remained unchanged 48 hours after pre-orders opened. Unlike iPhone sales, Vision Pro’s slower uptake hints at potential demand tapering after the initial surge from core fans and heavy users.

Q1 Beat Likely: Ives anticipates a first-quarter beat, considering the prevailing pessimistic sentiments. The negative narrative surrounding Apple has grown over the past year due to a lack of iPhone unit growth, causing many investors to question Cupertino’s future growth story, notes the analyst.
Key Items Of Interest: Ives points out that Wall Street will likely focus on iPhone revenue and the Services segment’s performance. Both are expected to have fared well during the December quarter, with consensus estimates for iPhone and Services revenue at $68 billion and $23 billion, respectively.

What Happened: Business Insider reported that the newly launched YieldMax Magnificent 7 Fund of Option Income ETFs will invest in seven established YieldMax single-stock ETFs. Announced on Tuesday, these funds use covered-call options strategies to generate capital gains and income from leading technology giants, including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).
The fund will be reallocated monthly to ensure an equal weighting of each of the seven YieldMax ETFs within the Fund’s holdings. The move would give accessibility and streamline ownership for shareholders, with indirect exposure to the Magnificent Seven through a single ETF.

*according to Benzinga Pro data
Apple’s first-quarter guidance issued in early November called for 2023-December quarter revenue to be flat with the year-ago period. This is despite having one less selling week than in the fourth quarter of 2022, said CFO Luca Maestri. He also flagged a one-percentage-point negative impact from forex. Since then, the U.S. dollar has weakened, potentially hurting the company less. The dollar index, which measures the greenback’s move against a basket of currencies, slid 4.36% in the December quarter amid expectations of Fed rate cuts.
Apple modeled a gross margin of 45% to 46%.
In a recent note, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring said he expects a healthy December quarter beat, with revenue and earnings per share likely coming in at $119  billion and $2.13, respectively.
Apple Product Categories: Roughly 50% of revenue comes from Apple’s flagship product, the iPhone. The company hinted at revenue growth for the product, on an absolute basis as well, after normalizing for both last year’s supply disruptions and the one extra week.

Given the Federal Reserve’s data-dependent stance, a couple of manufacturing activity data and the routine jobless claims data due for the day could draw traders’ attention.
Cues From Wednesday's Trading:
U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday, stung by the double-whammy of earnings disappointments and a hawkish Fed. Traders reacted negatively to earnings from Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), all of which have significant weightings in the S&P 500 Index.
The major indices started the session lower and moved roughly sideways until the Fed decision. The Dow was seen moving in and out of the unchanged line as it received support from a strong upward move in Boeing Co.’s (NYSE:BA) shares. The Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 indices languished in negative territory.
Following the rate decision, the indices either moved above the flat line or trimmed their losses. Jerome Powell disappointed traders by offering no clear signal toward a rate-cut schedule, so they dumped stocks in late afternoon trading.
The S&P 500 Index pulled further away from its record close, with the broader gauge and the Nasdaq Composite settling at the lowest levels in about two weeks. 
The market witnessed a broad-based sell-off, with communications stocks being the worst hit. IT, consumer discretionary, and energy stocks also saw marked weakness.

Stock Market Direction
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows the stock market has pulled back on Powell’s remarks.
The chart shows the stock market is near the top band of the support zone.
The chart shows that in the early trade, the dip in the stock market is being bought.
The FOMC rate decision came as expected yesterday. However, Powell trampled on the speculation of a rate cut in March. Please read yesterday’s Afternoon Capsule for details.
Fed Chair Powell said labor availability is a big factor in the Fed’s decision.
Previously, the Fed was trying to drive unemployment higher. The reason was in traditional economics, higher unemployment brings down inflation.
This cycle has defied traditional economics thus far. Inflation is coming down while unemployment remains very low.
In The Arora Report analysis of Powell’s press conference, the Fed is not worried about inflation running back up. However, the Fed is concerned about inflation being sticky and staying above their target. If the employment picture stays strong, it will be difficult for the Fed to cut interest rates as the Fed does not want inflation to get stuck above their target. This is the reason prudent investors are paying very close attention to the jobs report.
The jobs report, known as the mother of all reports, will be released tomorrow at 8:30am ET.
In The Arora Report analysis, the jobs report tomorrow is the key to the near-term direction of the stock market. If the jobs report is strong, the stock market will likely tumble. If the jobs report is weak, the stock market will likely run up. 
Weekly initial jobless claims came at 224K vs. 215K consensus. This indicates that the jobs picture is still very strong, but the data is beginning to weaken.
Q4 Productivity-Prel came at 3.2% vs. 2.1% consensus.

What Happened: The Apple Vision Pro has been eagerly anticipated by Apple fans and augmented reality enthusiasts for years, and they will finally be able to get their hands on the headsets Friday with a starting price of $3,499.
""Vision Pro is a new kind of computer that augments reality, (it) will change the way we collaborate, work, enjoy entertainment,"" Cook said when unveiling the device.
Cook recalled his first experience with the Vision Pro six to eight years ago, before it had its current name, according to an interview with Vanity Fair.
""You weren't really wearing it at that time. It wasn't wearable by any means of the imagination,"" Cook said.
During the interview, Cook wears the Apple Vision Pro and is seen on screens appearing on the moon.
""Tim Cook is on the moon! He's sitting right there. On the f***ing moon!"" the interviewer said.

(NASDAQ:META), Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Earnings remain mixed, raising concerns about both the economy and corporate profit growth. The non-farm payrolls report for January, anticipated before the market opens, is expected to heavily influence the day’s trading direction. A stronger-than-expected job gains report and/or any spike in wage growth could potentially reignite inflation fears, triggering selling pressure in the market.
Cues From Thursday's Trading:
Optimism preceding tech earnings and some favorable economic data contributed to gains across major averages on Thursday. The indices opened higher and remained range-bound in a sideways move until late-morning trading, with the Dow Industrials briefly dipping below the unchanged line. Subsequently, stocks initiated a rally and concluded near the session highs.
The majority of sectors displayed solid advancements during the session, illustrating the breadth of the rally, although energy stocks experienced some pullback.

The analyst noted the iPhone 15 is ""resonating with consumers,"" which could foreshadow a strong iPhone 16.
Ng also highlighted that Apple is investing in generative AI efforts and the company will share more efforts on that front later this year.

Blowout Jobs Report And Earnings
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows a rally after a shallow pullback.
The chart shows that the shallow pullback approached but did not penetrate the high band of the support zone. From a technical perspective this is a positive.
The chart shows an attempt of a new breakout. This new breakout would have likely followed through if it was not for the jobs report data upsetting bulls’ hopium this morning.
The jobs report is a blowout. Here are the details:

Non-farm payrolls came at 353K vs. 175K consensus.
Non-farm private payrolls came at 317K vs. 150K consensus.
Unemployment rate came at 3.7% vs. 3.8% consensus.
Average work week came at 34.1 vs. 34.4 consensus.


This is the strongest jobs report since January 2023.
In The Arora Report analysis, this jobs report is simply too strong for the Fed to cut rates. Even though Powell was clear that a rate cut in March was not the base case, stock market bulls have continued to buy stocks on hopes of a rate cut in March.  
In The Arora Report analysis, this jobs report significantly upsets stock market bulls’ hopium. If it was not for the blowout earnings from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META), the stock market would have likely fallen by as much as 1000 DJIA points on this report.  Now the questions for prudent investors are the following:
In view of blowout earnings from AMZN and META, will the momo crowd even care about the jobs report?

Will the new narrative of momo gurus that interest rates no longer matter ring true with investors?  
Layoffs helped AMZN and META report blowout earnings. If the premarket gains hold, META and AMZN have added about $275B in market cap since they reported earnings after the close yesterday.  


META is initiating its first dividend and a $50B buyback. The addition of a dividend and the buyback to stellar earnings is resulting in META stock running up 17.15% since it reported earnings to the time of this writing. This ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['Economics', 'Federal Reserve', 'Markets', 'Trading Ideas']",0.99929,Positive,https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/36913908

The long-running animated comedy “The Simpsons” may have predicted what happens when people wear virtual reality headsets at home and in public.
What Happened: Since the Vision Pro was released, images have gone viral of people wearing the headset on the street or the train. A driver of a Tesla vehicle was even pulled over wearing the Apple Vision Pro while driving.
While a world filled with people all wearing headsets in public could be years or decades away, ""The Simpsons"" may have predicted the disasters that could happen.
A clip from the 2016 episode titled ""Friends and Family"" went viral on X, formerly known as Twitter, over the weekend with more than eight million views. In the clip, residents of the fictional town of Springfield are seen wearing a virtual reality headset and subsequently running into light posts, falling down a manhole and laying in bed with a headset on next to a significant other also wearing a headset.
The clip features the Cream song ""I Feel Free"" playing in the background alluding to a world where headsets and virtual reality have taken over real-life interactions.

The analyst tested the Vision Pro and reacted positively to the highly unique and immersive experience.
However, he also noted that the typical hurdles most first-generation products face also hold for the Vision Pro (weight and battery life). 
The spatial computing paradigm is unique and expects developers to unleash numerous apps to drive increased use cases over time.
Based on his assumptions, the Vision Pro hardware can add 46 cents per share to EPS over the next five years. 
Mohan built out the Vision Pro installed base from the Mac installed base, giving similar affordability levels.

The group saw its combined worth surpass the total economic output of global cities such as New York, Tokyo, London, Los Angeles, London, Paris, Seoul, Chicago, San Francisco, Osaka and Shanghai, as highlighted by Michael Hartnett, Bank of America’s chief market strategist, in a recent note.
The stocks are now testing the “law of physics,” Bloomberg columnists John Authers and Isabelle Lee wrote on Monday. Ed Yardeni, a popular Wall Street industry veteran, said “the Mag-7 once again are sucking all the air out of the universe,” in a recent note addressing the spectacular jump of Meta Platforms.

After the judge's decision, Tesla's board has decisions to make, and some Tesla shareholders are showing their support for the automaker and its CEO, and have some ideas of their own.
What Happened: The judge's decision came after a Tesla shareholder challenged the compensation plan that tied Musk’s earnings to the performance of Tesla metrics like market capitalization, revenue and adjusted EBITDA.
The shareholder argued proper disclosures were not presented to investors before the plan was approved by shareholders and the company's board. 
Organized by Amy Steffens (@_SFTahoe) and Alexandra Merz (@TeslaBoomerMama), who are Tesla influencers and shareholders, an effort to rally shareholders in support of Musk and the Tesla board is underway. 
The duo helped gather signatures from 5,821 Tesla shareholders representing 23,337,127 TSLA shares.

What Happened: Data, provided by Nasdaq eVestment showed that among the worst-performing strategies was the equity long-short fund — where hedge fund managers buy stocks they think will perform well and bet against stocks they believe are likely to fall.
Indeed, investors have pulled more than $150 billion from this type of fund over the past five years as they have underperformed the market in nine of the past 10 years.
The equity long-short fund has been around for decades and was generally successful during periods of broadly calm market conditions as so-called “star stock pickers” were able to capitalize strongly on market fluctuations by buying long and selling short.
When more turbulent conditions persist, it becomes much more difficult for stock pickers to predict. One of the chief problems for pickers last year, however, was the expectation that several mega-cap stocks had become so overvalued that they had become ripe for shorting.

It added: “Money laundering through real estate can negatively affect home prices, particularly since illicit actors seeking to integrate illicit funds may be willing to over or under pay for a property.”

(NYSE:CMG), and Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE:LLY).
What Happened: On Wednesday, Cramer questioned the rationale behind the market’s behavior, emphasizing that not all stock movements are logical, especially during earnings season, reported CNBC.
""Each day on this front is a reminder that you can't just assume all moves on your screen are the products of any intelligence, especially during earnings season when the market's overrun by idiocy,"" he said. 
""So, when you see some action that doesn't make sense, keep in mind that authentic stupidity is a perfectly plausible explanation, especially when it's sending down stocks that should be going higher.""
He criticized the treatment of Apple stock, stating that despite initial skepticism, the launch of the Vision Pro resulted in a significant shift in sentiment. Cramer has long been an advocate of Apple and was quick to recognize the value of the new virtual reality product before its official release.
Regarding Chipotle, Cramer believes it was a mistake for investors to be cautious due to poor earnings from other fast-food chains. ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['News', 'Analyst Color', 'Equities', 'Markets', 'Analyst Ratings']",0.68219,Negative,https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/36997732

What Happened: Brian Belski, the chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, believes that the current market risk due to the dominance of mega-cap tech stocks is being overestimated. He stated in a note on Tuesday that the risk is not as severe as some might think, reported Business Insider.
The “Magnificent 7” mega-cap tech stocks, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), currently account for 29% of the S&P 500.
Although a potential decline in demand for these stocks poses a risk, Belski is confident that the broader market can still yield positive returns even if the mega-cap tech stocks falter.
“Our work shows that the stock market has held up just fine in prior periods when the outperformance of mega-cap stocks started to wane,” Belski said.

Here’s a look at how much return an investment in a basket comprising the Magnificent seven stocks in equal proportion would have fetched vis-a-vis Cathie Wood-led Ark Investment’s flagship Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK).
New Group On The Block: FAANG was the precursor to the group, now collectively called the Magnificent Seven. Originally named FANG by Jim Cramer in 2013, the group became known as FAANG with the addition of Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in 2017. The original members were Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), which then went by the name Facebook, Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), formerly Google.
Later iterations were MAGA, which included Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) along with Apple, Alphabet and Amazon, and MAMAA, comprising Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon.
The phrase Magnificent Seven was first used by BofA Securities analyst Michael Hartnett in 2023. The constituent companies spearheaded the stock market rebound during the year, thanks to the dominant market positioning, innovativeness, brand appeal and financial muscle of these companies. This group comprises the biggest mega-cap techs including Meta, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).

S&P 500 At 5000
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that S&P 500 is comfortably above the top band of the support zone.  
The chart shows that the move up is on lower volume. This is a negative. 
Historically, when S&P 500 hits the next 1000 benchmark, the median return is as follows:

0.57% after one week
2.00% after one month
3.5% after three months
7.73% after six months


The above data is only history, and no one should depend on it. It is more important to understand how various groups behave.  

Sentiment moves higher in the extreme zone.
Momo crowd buying becomes even more aggressive.
Mom and pop who are normally not active in the stock market jump in.
Bears throw in the towel and jump in.
Underperforming money managers become aggressive buyers.
Smart money takes advantage of the strength and trims positions. 


“Buy low and sell high” is a simple concept in theory. This is exactly what you need to do to consistently beat the stock market. However, in practice it is not as easy as it sounds for the following reasons:

Human emotions of fear and greed.
Market mechanics
Market controlled by momo crowd
Momo gurus
Short squeezes
Thousands of constantly changing variables from across the globe


The key is to look at returns, not only in terms of absolute returns, but in terms of risk adjusted returns.
As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in the protection band, which strikes the optimum balance between various crosscurrents. Please scroll down to see the protection band. 

Jobless Claims
Initial Jobless Claims came at 218K vs. 218K consensus. This indicates that the jobs picture is staying strong.  Initial Jobless Claims is a leading indicator and carries heavy weight in our adaptive ZYX Asset Allocation Model with inputs in ten categories.  In plain English, adaptiveness means that the model changes itself with market conditions. Most models on Wall Street are static. They work for a while and then stop working when market conditions change.
Treasury Auction
Yesterday, we shared with you that the largest ever 10-year Treasury auction was still. Please read the Afternoon Capsule for details.

The Apple Analyst: Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives has an “Outperform” rating and a $250 price target for Apple shares.
The Apple Thesis: New Asia supply chain checks show a “clear stabilization” demand in China, with iPhone units expected to show “incremental growth,” said Ives in a note. This validates the analyst’s prediction of the iPhone 15 triggering an upgrade cycle that surpasses Street expectations.
Investors reacted negatively to Apple’s quarterly results released in early February, as the China region reported a year-over-year revenue decline.
The analyst now expects iPhone unit sales of 225 million to 230 million units for this year and the average selling price of its flagship device to exceed $900, given the product mix shift moving toward the two high-end models.

Note the following:

The chart shows the 2021 high in small caps.
The chart shows the high in small caps in 2023.
The chart shows small caps are still well below the 2021 high.
Small caps staged a big rally in 2023, but small caps have not rocketed to new highs like the S&P 500. This may be an opportunity for investors. Here is what investors should keep in mind:

IWM could be a catch up trade.
On the other hand, small caps should have performed better than they have.The difference could be explained due to the lack of high flying AI stocks in IWM, or the difference could be a warning.
Small caps are interest rate sensitive and should do well when the Fed cuts rates.
Small caps are economically sensitive. As such, small caps should do well if there is no landing.
IWM includes many banks. If there is no banking crisis, IWM should do well.
If the overall stock market maintains its gains, small caps provide an opportunity to investors.


Fed speak is ahead. The Fed’s Michelle Bowman, Tom Barkin, and Neel Kashkari will be speaking today.
Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be released Tuesday at 8:30am ET. The stock market is assuming that inflation will continue to go down. If CPI shows that inflation is continuing to come down, S&P 500 will rally. On the other hand, if CPI is stronger than expected, there is a lot of air in the stock market and as such may lead to a rapid pullback.

Hotter Inflation
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows a slight pullback on inflation data.
The chart shows volume continues to be low, indicating lack of conviction.
The volume today will be a tell. If the stock market pulls back on heavy volume on bad inflation data, that will be an indication that the bulls are losing control. On the other hand, if the stock market has only a shallow pullback or goes up on lower volume, that will be an indication that bulls continue to be in control.
CPI was worse than expected. Here are the details:

Headline CPI came at 0.3% month-over-month vs. 0.2% consensus.
Core CPI came at 0.4% month-over-month vs. 0.3% consensus.


In yesterday’s Morning Capsule, we shared with you:

Momo gurus are already being proactive to prevent a selloff if the data shows that inflation is not coming down. The new mantra of momo gurus is that stocks will go up even if inflation does not come down. Keep in mind that momo gurus’ real job is to run up the stock market under the disguise of analysis.


Momo gurus are extremely clever. Realizing that their new narrative was not that good, now they have come up with a more persuasive narrative to persuade their followers to buy stocks. The new narrative is that this rise in inflation is a one-off.
The CPI data today shows that Powell’s fear of Burns’ blunder is justified. Arthur Burns was the most intelligent Fed Chairman. He lowered rates when inflation came down but was forced to raise rates again when inflation picked up again. This is known as Burns’ blunder.
New earnings are having an impact on the stock market.

Daniel Ives and his team at Wedbush predict a surge in technological investments towards AI in the coming decade. This anticipation stems from the evident monetization of AI technologies, as demonstrated in recent earnings reports across the tech sector.

Kumar noted that the IoT business in the longer term could ultimately provide Qualcomm with $1.5 billion+ in quarterly revenues further down the line as more industrial-edge devices come online.

Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE: UBER).
Note the following:

The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of UBER stock is being used to illustrate the point.
The chart shows the jump up in UBER stock on the news of the buy back.
The chart shows the Arora buy zone and the power of buy zones. The example from UBER on the chart represents a profit 208%.
UBER is a prime example and a key reminder to investors that there are opportunities beyond the magnificent seven and AI. While the magnificent seven stocks and AI have been driving the stock market, there are opportunities for investors in less expensive stocks with better potential for risk adjusted returns. The magnificent seven stocks are Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ: GOOG), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA).
There is apparently a new serious national security threat. Read the section on Russia below.

There is a new milestone in AI –Nvidia’s market cap is now higher than the market cap of Amazon and Alphabet.
Weekly Initial Claims came at 212K vs. 221K consensus. In The Arora Report analysis, the jobs picture continues to be strong, especially at the low end. The jobs picture continues to be weak in IT.  
The U.S. economy is 70% consumer based. For this reason, prudent investors pay attention to retail sales. The consumer has been on a binge of excessive spending. Momo gurus have been predicting that the consumer will continue with excessive spending. At The Arora Report, we have been sharing with you that consumer liquidity is becoming less and will ultimately impact consumer ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['Economics', 'Markets', 'General']",0.99999,Positive,https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/37162370

Hartnett’s insights reveal that while every bubble is unique, they share common catalysts such as technological innovation, new markets and, notably, central bank easing. These elements have historically converged to inflate asset prices beyond sustainable levels.
The AI bubble, for example, was ignited by the Federal Reserve’s response to Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse and the subsequent rise of ChatGPT. This scenario mirrors past bubbles such as the Plaza Accord’s effect on Japan and the internet bubble fueled by the Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) crisis. 
Similarly, policy stimuli in response to the COVID-19 pandemic inflated crypto and tech stocks, reminiscent of the Mississippi and South Sea Company bubbles sparked by changes to English usury laws in 1714.

Hotter Inflation

Note the following:

The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of AMAT stock is being used to illustrate the point.
As we have been sharing with you, Applied Materials is the best “picks and shovels” play in artificial intelligence.
Artificial intelligence needs more sophisticated chips. To manufacture more sophisticated chips, companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE: TSM) and Intel Corp (NASDAQ: INTC) are buying more sophisticated equipment to manufacture the chips. Applied Materials is a big beneficiary.
The chart shows the big jump in AMAT stock on earnings.
RSI on the chart shows that AMAT is overbought.
The power of the demand for AI is reflected in the following earnings details from AMAT:

The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.13 vs. $1.90 consensus.
The company reported revenue of $6.71B vs. $6.48B consensus.
The company is forecasting revenue for the current quarter with a midpoint of $6.5B vs. $6.34B consensus.


The strength in AMAT is pushing tech stocks higher, especially AI stocks.
The rise in AMAT stock shows that “picks and shovels” is a great strategy.  
Producer Price Index (PPI) came hotter than expected, just as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) did on Tuesday. Here are the details:

Analysts offered their take on the upcoming results.
Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson maintained Nvidia with an Outperform and raised the price target from $600 to $800.
The analyst noted that Nvidia will surpass estimates again and raise future guidance. During his mid-December travels in Asia, component suppliers and Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs) indicated strong quarter trends. 
They predicted further growth in the first quarter, with potential concerns about Cloud Service Providers (CSP) growth slowing in late 2024.

However, recent earnings reports from CSPs show continued momentum in AI infrastructure spending, with many large data center operators planning to increase capital expenditure in 2024, primarily for AI investments.
Bryson’s recent discussions with memory vendors revealed a continued high demand for High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), with Nvidia expected to be the largest consumer of these components in 2024. 
The fourth quarter also saw significant capital raises for AI startups, which will likely benefit AI infrastructure providers either through direct purchases of AI systems or by renting AI infrastructure.
Super Micro Computer Inc (NASDAQ:SMCI) reported a significant sales acceleration during the quarter, with growth in backlog driven by AI sales.

Tepid Consumer
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT).
Note the following:

The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of WMT stock is being used to illustrate the point.
The U.S. economy is 70% consumer based, and Walmart is the largest retailer in the U.S. Therefore, investors should pay close attention to Walmart.
The chart shows the stock is going higher as of this writing.
The chart shows when Walmart reported earnings. Walmart beat earnings estimates for the last quarter. Here are the details:

Q4 revenue came at $173.4B vs. $158.4B consensus.
Walmart hit $100B in e-commerce sales.
Q1 adjusted EPS came at $1.48-$1.56 vs. $1.48 consensus.
Dividend increased by 9%.


The stock market has held up, in part, due to excess consumer spending.
Stock market bulls are counting on excess consumer spending continuing.
Walmart earnings are painting a tepid picture of the consumer. Walmart says shoppers are staying “choiceful.” The data from Walmart runs counter to stock market bulls’ hopium of the consumer continuing to spend excessively.
Walmart stock is running up, in part, because Walmart is buying Vizio Holding Corp (NYSE: VZIO) to expand advertising. VZIO is in the ZYX Buy portfolio that surrounds the Model Portfolio, and VZIO is the 191st Arora Portfolio company to be bought out.  
As we have stated before, the most critical item for the stock market is NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA) earnings. For details, please see ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['Cryptocurrency', 'Economics', 'Markets', 'General']",0.99969,Neutral,https://www.benzinga.com/amp/content/37216997

Fed Minutes: What To Expect
In its January policy meeting, the Federal Reserve opted to maintain interest rates steady, within the range of 5.25% to 5.5%, largely aligning with market forecasts. 
The Fed’s statement highlighted that the economy is growing at a solid pace, with job gains, though moderated, remaining strong and the unemployment rate persisting at low levels. Inflation, while having decelerated over the past year, continues to be elevated.
Notably, the Fed removed any mention of “additional policy firming,” hinting at a halt in rate increases.

The Seattle-based e-commerce giant is replacing pharmacy company Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA). In recent years, Walgreens has seen its shares plummet 28.4% in 2022; 30.1% in 2023; and 14.6% in 2024.
Amazon stock tumbled 51% in 2022 but came roaring back more than 100% since the beginning of 2023. Now it’s on deck to join DJIA — the so-called “venerable index.”
As one of Wall Street’s oldest stock indicators, the DJIA doesn’t get shaken up often. The last member to join was Walgreens in 2018 when it replaced  General Electric, which enjoyed a 111-year tenure. Still, membership carries a certain prestige. Or does it?
“I remember when this would have mattered,” Scott Nations, founder of Nations Indexes, said on social media following the announcement.

The Magnificent Seven accounts for a record 13% of the aggregate hedge fund long portfolios. Yet, it remains significantly underweighted compared to a 26% collective stake in the Russell 3000 — underscoring a cautious approach towards mega-cap equities.

Biotech Breakout
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (ARCA: XBI).
Note the following:

The chart shows biotech has broken out.
The chart shows the move up was on high volume, indicating conviction in the move.
The chart shows when XBI was in the Arora buy zone. This represents a 54% gain in about four months. XBI is in the ZYX Allocation Core Model Portfolio by The Arora Report.
RSI on the chart shows that biotech is overbought.
The breakout in biotech shows there are opportunities for investors beyond AI, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA), and big tech.
Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE: LLY) is a prime example. LLY has gained 139% in about a year.
In important news for AI, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) has canceled its electric vehicle project.  About 2,000 people have been working on this project. Apple seems to be recognizing that it needs to devote more resources to AI. This is good news for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA).
Just released GDP data shows the economy is very strong and there is inflation pressure. Here are the details:

Q4 GDP Second Estimate came at 3.2% vs. 3.2% consensus.
GDP Deflator Second Estimate came at 1.6% vs. 1.5% consensus.


Prudent investors should keep in mind that GDP is a lagging indicator. The Arora Report system is based on leading indicators in ten categories. Please click here to see the ten categories of the ZYX Asset Allocation Model.
The latest consumer confidence data indicates that there is a high probability of this stock market rally stalling and even pulling back. Consumer confidence came at 106.7 vs. 114.6  consensus.

Inflation Gauge
Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market has failed to make progress since the release of hotter CPI.
The chart shows that the stock market was pulling back before the release of PCE, but improved on release of PCE.
The stock market has been anxiously awaiting PCE. PCE is the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge. PCE rose the most in a year. Here are the details:

Headline PCE came at 0.3% vs. 0.4% consensus.
Core PCE came at 0.4% vs. 0.4% consensus.


In The Arora Report analysis, the stock market improved on the release of the PCE data as there was fear of an even worse number.
Digging into the data that underlies PCE, in The Arora Report analysis, there is deflation in goods, but there is serious inflation in services. Deflation in goods is coming from China.
The release of PCE data has triggered aggressive buying in AI stocks and bitcoin. The buying is especially aggressive in C3.ai Inc (NYSE: AI) after the release of PCE data. C3.ai released better than expected earnings after the close yesterday. As a full disclosure, a signal was given in The Arora Report's ZYX Buy Change Alert.
The release of PCE data is also leading to very aggressive buying in small caps. As a full disclosure, iShares Russell 2000 ETF (ARCA: IWM) and its buy zone are in The Arora Report's ZYX Allocation Core Model Portfolio.
Personal income and spending data was also released this morning. Here are the details:

What Happened: Apple has had several eventful months with the release of the iPhone 15 in September and the Vision Pro mixed reality headset in February.
Goldman Sachs Group (NYSE:GS) removed Apple from its Conviction List, but notes that the stock remains Buy rated. The price target for Apple was $232 in the latest note from Goldman Sachs after first-quarter earnings.
""There are many reasons a stock could get removed from the list. The can include (but are not limited to), analysts no longer having conviction in their idea, price realization, the passage of catalysts or the subcommittee believing there are better opportunities elsewhere,"" the company said.
Given that Apple retains a Buy rating, it suggests that the analysts’ belief in the stock hasn’t waned. With Apple’s shares experiencing a 5% decline over the past month and a 6% decrease since the beginning of the year, it seems unlikely that the stock’s removal is due to price realization.
In this case, Apple being removed from the Conviction List likely came from the passage of catalysts and/or there being better opportunities elsewhere.

Despite the sharper-than-expected contraction revealed by the ISM Manufacturing PMI in February – with the overall index plummeting from 49.5 to 47.8, missing the anticipated 49.1 – investors remained upbeat. The data triggered downward pressure on the dollar and Treasury yields, maintaining firm expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts.
Fed speakers – including Goolsbee, Waller and Bostic – offered a mixed bag of remarks, though collectively acknowledging the ongoing progress toward disinflation. Additionally, a Fed report highlighted that inflation expectations broadly align with the 2% target.
In the tech sector, the semiconductor industry continued its remarkable performance, buoyed by escalating demand for chips associated with artificial intelligence. The industry benchmark, as monitored by the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX), surged 3.7% following a 2.7% leap on Thursday, marking its highest level since inception.

According to Peter Callahan, a sector specialist at Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets, it’s not just a fleeting phenomenon but is rooted in sustainable and enduring fundamentals.

The S&P 500 Index is up over 25% in the past year. 
This is evident by the price appreciation seen in ETFs tracking it — the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY), the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO) and the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV).
At the forefront of this surge are the Magnificent Seven tech stocks. These have played a pivotal role in driving the S&P 500’s recent rally.

The Nasdaq 100, as tracked by the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), soared past the 18,300 mark to achieve an unprecedented high. The S&P 500, as monitored through the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), surged above 5,100 points, also hitting record highs.
